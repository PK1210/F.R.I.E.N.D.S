The @IPL #VIVOIPL is one of the biggest celebrations of the game of cricket because of the the representation of players from around the world .Let us please refrain from using terms like Indian players vs Overseas players; they all play for the same team.
@ed_rainsford Thanks for your explanation. In that case who is at fault? A passionate player or the third umpire who have to keep the emotions aside and make the right implementation of the law. It was given OUT after review.
@ed_rainsford Ed, help me out with the new rule/law. Never shy of learning the sport that I love. I do understand if you are not a professional player it takes a lifetime to know all the rules in totality.
This is the rule; how one tries to implement is irrelevant. #AshwinMankads #KXIPvRR https://t.co/4aJREXqMxo
