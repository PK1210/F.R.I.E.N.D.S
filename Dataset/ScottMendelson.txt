@JKdarkknight @jramjee @Forbes Correct.
@filmnerdjamie It was inevitable as long as he wanted to do it.
@WesLara @shivampercy @Forbes It's not a monopoly, it's just moviegoers ignoring everything else from every other studio and then complaining that Hollywood doesn't make anything but superhero movies, remakes and toons.
@shivampercy @Forbes I was fine with ENDGAME making a gazillion dollars. At least that was an of-the-moment triumph that was earned through a decade of crowd-pleasing and well-respected genre flicks. This is pure nostalgia. Even THE FORCE AWAKENS was comparatively a "new" movie.
