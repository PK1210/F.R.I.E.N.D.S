Disgusting! Repulsive! Disappointing! https://t.co/zhuegUz0wO
The longer Congress drags the karnataka nƒÅtaka, the slimmer will be the chances for it to cross 60 seat mark in K'tsks in the next polls

Cong under dumb Rahul already committed a blunder by forming the suicidal alliance. Dragging this further will be the last nail in its coffin!

Disqualification will be quashed by the court if done in this manner by a speaker. Disqualification won't save the govt, plus if it doesn't stand the scrutiny of the court, won't affect the rebels either https://t.co/eYYFL3MXFN
Not only remove, he should be booked for contempt and shameful conduct and misuse of powers of the speaker https://t.co/al8Yob6Khg
Love this land?!

He wants to act holier than thou and at the same time get his last few files signed and passed from Taj westend. What crockery! https://t.co/Atwsabzl7u
They wrote &amp; signed the resignation letters right in front of him, with their OWN hands &amp; submitted them! This must be the most bizarre way to abuse speakers office. How long can a sinking party FORCE/threaten disinteredted MLAs to stay back?!

Ramesh Kumar's conduct is shameful! https://t.co/TDC6fa84h9
Disqualification for resigning. First time in the history of karnataka legislative history

Can tweeples stop ra**di rona over world cup?! They went into semifinals and put up a brave fight. Kiwis and aussies are much better teams this time around and deserve to win the WC more than the Indian team!

Move on!
@blackcat_1iii God forbid!
1. Arunachal Cong merged into BJP
2. MGP merged into BJP
3. Mass defections from Cong to BJP in Manipur
4. TS Cong merged into TRS
5. TDP RS party merged into BJP
5. Goa Cong merges now into BJP

All within a 5 years

Absolute mockery of people's mandate. Spare me whataboutry!
If you had comfortable majority already, along with your allies, what was the need to merge an entire legislature party of your chief opposition, filled with people who you opposed all your lives?!!

Absolutely pointless expansionism which will ultimately lead to a free fall!

One after the other, Legislature, parliamentary parties merging into other parties

Dr K Sudhakar confirms that he was physically assaulted by his Congress colleagues in Karnataka assembly after he submitted his resignation to the speaker

He calls the incident extremely unfortunate and that he is bewildered by this unruly behaviour of people in power!
So far, 16 MLAs(13 Con And 3 JDS) have resigned 

That means, effective strength of KA assembly is now 208. Half way is 105. BJP has 105. Plus, non attached members H Nagesh of Mulabagal &amp; R Shankar of Ranebennur along with BSP‚Äôs lone MLA might back BJP

Interesting times ahead!
Look how Priyanka Kharge and Dinesh Gundurao manhandle Congress MLA Dr K Sudhakar!

Such desperation to save power even after decisively getting electorally rejected in 2 elections in one year @dineshgrao @PriyankKharge @siddaramaiah @DKShivakumar ?!!

Such desperation that you'd try to convince an MLA to stay with you by assaulting him?! Disgusting!
Chikkaballapura MLA Dr K Sudhakar locked up in KJGeorge's office, physically assaulted, shirt torn off by starry eyed dynasts of Congress. This is too disgusting even by Con standards

K'taka is a laughing stock!

End this here and now @siddaramaiah @dineshgrao @PriyankKharge

Surreal developments in Karnataka 

MLAs and Ministers are literally running away from the state Congress president and Congress leadership. Everyone seems to have had enough of this coalition drama

This has always been an alliance of contradictions and was bound to fail badly!
