On the next @androidcentral podcast @journeydan, @AraWagco reveal our phone usage stats for 'yesterday'. What's your guestimate for my usage?
Is this a question? Because it doesn't seem like I'm able to say "no". https://t.co/epu0LPXQWO

Challenge: try and find a positive tweet on https://t.co/XqjYtuoCMr about Dropbox suddenly defaulting to opening its unwanted app instead of Finder, registering itself as a startup app, etc. Hard to think of a more user hostile and unwanted move by a major app in recent memory.
@Dezmadrack The new APK download didn't work. Try this direct link: https://t.co/S31weswii1
@zaherg That's a helpful video, but this is not a solution for the mainstream. Also requires rather specific tools. Nintendo should be fixing the problem properly.
@Dezmadrack Can you please provide specifics here? In what way does it not appear? Screenshot?
@DantheClamMan Glad to hear it!
In my case, I sent my drifting Joy Con back to Nintendo and was told they found water damage. It never had water spilt on it. I had no choice but to pay ~AU$50 for a replacement. Process took about 2 weeks. A few months later, the other Joy Con is drifting. üò°
I ‚ù§ the Switch, but this Joy Con drift issue is unacceptable. Feels to me like it's Nintendo's version of the MacBook keyboard woes, but more widespread. @thetruebowser &amp; co. should instigate a global, no questions asked replacement policy.

@VladislavKluska I've never liked how that mechanic works so am glad to ditch it. But I hear you all the same. I'm certainly of the mind the system should allow 3rd party launchers should be able to offer the same behavior if they implement it.
@cologneworkx Your browser is likely set to not allow installing APKs.
@cologneworkx Please be specific as to what happens when you attempt to download.

@AraWagco I don't believe SystemUI is covered by Project Mainline currently. In this case, we will rely on Google ensuring OEMs integrate fixes manually, which is obviously far from ideal. 

That said, Mainline does allow for new APIs to be added.
What timing! https://t.co/vNr0H44eZb
@MishaalRahman @RonAmadeo Examples are transition animations as well as the integration of Pixel Launcher's all apps drawer in the Recents screen. There's no reason APIs couldn't exist to handle this of course. I'm actually hopeful we might see them going forward.
@chrisonline1205 https://t.co/FichpJ62zY
Action Launcher has a disproportionately large share of users on newer Android versions than most apps. That said, my biggest fear is OEMs forking the first Q release and not integrating Google's promised fixes, leading to this being a lasting issue. https://t.co/AZMzWI8i6E
RT @AndroidPolice: Third-party launchers won't be able to use Android Q's new gesture navigation at launch https://t.co/vdajjo7IpR https://‚Ä¶
I find it rather alarming that Q's navigation gestures still seem so in flux this late in Q's beta process. https://t.co/b7Iaz6mKsF
Action Launcher development is entirely unchanged by this news, and will continue in earnest. The next Action Launcher update, featuring Dark theme support (including for Google Discover/Now integration), Quicktheme enhancements and more, is 90% done and should release very soon.
In brief: it's very frustrating, but the Android team does seem committed to fixing 3rd party launcher compatibility for Q this year via updates. Assuming they follow through, IMO this will be a short-term inconvenience rather than a bad sign for launcher viability going forward.
A note on the announcement that Android Q's gesture navigation will be incompatible with 3rd party launchers (including Action Launcher) at launch, and what this means for Action Launcher:
https://t.co/hS3SXy3Lt5
I would not be upset if Android Studio's debugger defaulted to displaying variables tagged with @ColorInt in hex.
@RDRv3 Wind Waker is more charming, but for me it felt 2-3 dungeons light, and thus less than it might have been. Conversely, Ocarina is a complete masterpiece. Also, Ocarina has Zelda's best ever dungeon in the Water Temple. So that's a no.
@AraWagco @Nova_Launcher @SmartLauncher5 The situation is on the Android team's radar.
@Saemin4655 There's no master option for that I'm afraid. Settings -&gt; Desktop -&gt; Grid and Settings -&gt; Desktop -&gt; Icon scale should go a long way though.
@Saemin4655 It sounds like "Settings -&gt; Import &amp; backup -&gt; Restore default layout" is what you're after. If not, what are you looking to reset?
@ArtemR @gamasutra Surely "I've recently stumbled upon your website..." was enough of a red flag?!

@koush The lazy Hollywood "all the baddies can neutered by taking out the redundancy-less server" trope aside, I actually didn't have any problem with Arya landing that blow. My Thrones gripes are more with the implementation of their decisions, which all felt needlessly rushed.
@koush You're right labelling it a 'retcon'. Heretofore I've subconsciously equated 'retcon' with 'a poorly handled retcon', which is my error. Recton or not, IW + Endgame felt like a cohesive setup + payoff that enhanced what came before. It was the opposite for Thrones S7 + S8.
@koush Obviously Endgame undid the snap, but given it ends with the massive time jump intact and 4 of the 6 OG Avengers largely off the board, I don't think it's fair to label it a retcon.
Infinity War and Endgame both upped the stakes and still nailed the landing. 
Game of Thrones' final seasons basically said "here, take The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 - we're outta here."
24 hrs on I'm even less enthused about Thrones's final season.
Arya's "no one knows what's west of Westeros" plot is absurd - she's stood directly next to Bran, who can *literally see the history of all humanity*.

As far as satisfying series finales go, I put Game of Thrones much closer to Lost's mediocrity than Breaking Bad's flawlessness.

@dabrianator I don't think it's realistic to expect Stadia to operate well on anything less than a strong network connection. And I think that's entirely fine.
There's 5G demos at I/O. Given my fears of the bulk 5G radios would add to  devices, I approached in an extremely sceptical frame of mind, but was pleasantly surprised. Some of the devices were unwieldy, but the Galaxy S10 5G seemed great (for large phone lovers at least).
@rharter @vishnurajeevan @ActionLauncher Yeah I spoke with the System UI folks yesterday about it. I expect it'll be much better for the final release.
As with any game platform, Stadia's success will ultimately come down to the games, and to a lesser extent price/business model. From a tech level, it seems Stadia performs well, and I love its promise of playing on any screen. I'm a bull on Stadia.
I had a bit of lag controlling the character, but I felt that was due to the game itself rather than Stadia. E.g, when doing a 180 during a run, the game reacts slowly, playing a turn around animation. I did not feel lag moving the character itself around in general.
Stadia seems great. I played Assassin's Creed, which is surely a great choice of game for the platform. I spent most of my time gauging the responsiveness. Overall I think it performed very well. Definitely well enough for people to play without being hamstrung by Stadia itself.
@koush I don't want to have to buy a new TV to use Netflix, Play Movies and YouTube on a big screen. I want a Pixel Player.

So the time heist accusation was unfounded. AirPods case was mistaken for dental floss and returned to the bathroom cupboard üòÇ
Could the person who stole my AirPods right off my desk in a time heist hurry up and put them back already?
@inik Honestly, I find this is a very common reaction by folks who consider things for a moment. I'm really trying to be transparent and above board with efforts to earn the revenue needed to keep growing Action Launcher. Thanks for understanding!
