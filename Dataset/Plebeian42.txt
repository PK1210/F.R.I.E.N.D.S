@vivekt17 + Then you think more: about the purpose, origins, and the nuances of language - what it really means to communicate. And the more I thought about it, the more sense "maths" made. But, as I said, hadn't thought enough to articulate it. Your points are brilliant‚Å†‚Äîand they work +

@vivekt17 Oh man, this is wonderfully articulated. Thank you. As I said, for me, it was more of a 'feeling'‚Å†‚ÄîI hadn't really processed them as clearly as you've. I, like numerous Indian kids, was in the habit of saying "maths". But then, a few years ago, when I was trying to obsessively+
@vivekt17 It's quite crazy how much I've thought about this. Would like to know your views. Is it because 'Maths' is colloquial and is, for the lack of a better word, more 'authentically Indian'?
@BabaJogeshwari It kind of looks like (or that he has very minimal help). What an incredible guy - I'm a huge fan.
@tweepul Ah, the Borders series. I don't know if they've a dedicated Twitter (or FB) account - I usually go to their YouTube page to check videos.
@tweepul You mean, only India-related videos? They did a small series on it (four videos).
The video: https://t.co/jAEnhD4Zg9. These videos are also technically accomplished: wonderfully edited, good background score, great use of text and graphics. The result? An immersive piece, with important information, that tells a good story. This is what we need more of.
Or the one about India and Sri Lanka's violent clash over fish. A video done with so much heart and art, that many Indians (who are otherwise rabidly nationalist online) were compelled to comment: "I'm an Indian but feel really bad for the deprived Sri Lankan community".
Their Border series, especially, is wonderful. Take this story for instance. It's on India's borders - a story that has been done more than 1,000 times. And then Vox does it: https://t.co/XsnaF906xx
I'm a big fan of Vox's (video) journalism. There's so much here that smug Indian journalists can learn from.

I quite liked the writing that this WC inspired. But Indian cricket writing, at times, can veer towards self-parody. &lt;A long-flowing dramatic sentence describing a shot, a delivery, or a catch. And then a sentence fragment. Like this. And this. And more this.&gt; We get it, guys.

Time to retire you, lad. We had a good time; we had a good team; we played well, but it wasn't to be.

@nowme_datta lol, I found that bit funny. The guy painted an evocative picture - gotta give credit where it's due :p
@sanimastudent Maybe it can. It's just that I haven't figured out a way to do it.
@sanimastudent But you raise a good point. I feel a good piece of criticism can be art in itself‚Äïit tells a story, has its own inner-universe and -logic. So can such an endeavour a) treat the film as a whole, b) also in parts (even including, say, the 'meh' aspects), c) do all this in 1K words?
@sanimastudent I get your point. But as I said, it gets mentioned when it's an exercise in addition or subtraction - otherwise, if it's just filling the gaps, then it's rather pointless. Except editing, which is tough to comment on, because you don't really know the source material.
@nowme_datta haha yeah, you're right, but you know how it is...
@sanimastudent The visual/aural imagination becomes a part of criticism when it uplifts/sinks a film/series. I mostly review Hindi films, where the craft is hardly remarkable. And I don't believe that every piece of criticism needs to necessarily talk about the craft when it's just about okay.
@sanimastudent I didn't think it was well made in terms of craft as well - the series, in my opinion, failed to evoke a futuristic society, which informed the original text. I briefly discuss the sloppy production design. The rest was competent/functional - nothing remarkable - so I left it out
@filmibaby haha, well...
@PouloCruelo yeah :/

Really enjoyed playing the 2011 WC, and the 2012 T-20 WC, on Cricinfo. Kind of regretting playing Dream11 now. And the worst part is, it's too late to change.
The 'Free Hits' option of Dream11 Fantasy cricket - and 5 trades for every 5 marches - make the whole thing way too gimmicky. It's not testing your cricketing knowledge as much as it's making it a sophisticated form of betting.

Lost 12 matches on trot (including a warm-up against Afghanistan), got folded out on 105 in their first game, and now this - take a bow, guys, absolutely brilliant.
What was brilliant was the way they kept accelerating between 20-40 overs. That's where this World Cup at.
