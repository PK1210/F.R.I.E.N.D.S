@BernieSanders If you want compassion and solidarity, you definitely don’t want capitalism.
@jeremycorbyn The rich looking after politicians so they look after the rich is how capitalism works.
@stillgray Trying to blame such disgusting behavior on anti-capitalists obviously appeals to someone like you, but this hypothesis is garbage. In reality, such behavior is down to many people having little respect for others simply because alienating anti-social divisive capitalism exists.
@IvankaTrump Liar. Workers are being exploited and deprived just as always. It is the capitalist class who are thriving because the level of inequality is now immense, leaving the rich richer than they have ever been.
@covert_left @LgBonagura Yes, socialism and communism are the same for us just as they were for Marx. Marx thought a “first phase” was necessary in 1848 as he thought there would be shortages, but this phase has long since been unnecessary because the means of production can now produce more than enough.
@BrianMastFL Depends what you mean by “socialism”. If you mean trying to reform capitalism that those on the Left (Bernie Sanders, AOC et al) advocate, then you’re right. That doesn’t work. But if you mean the class-free socialism of Marx and Engels, you’re wrong. That will work just great. https://t.co/Qa3Ocq1MU7
@moiraforbes @MellodyHobson “Show me a better one. I can’t find it.”

@The_Tricksterrr @VAKruta No country has had a post-capitalist class-free society.
@VAKruta Socialism and communism were exactly the same thing for Marx and Engels. And like I said, the Soviet never had this. The population never brought about a class-free society where they collectively owned the means of production.
@VAKruta The Soviet Union had a profit-driven capitalist under state control. That is called state capitalism (Google it. Learn something). Not socialism. https://t.co/1reCNVCTUm

@AssiSousana A comparatively small fine is just a slap on the wrist. Staff underpaid by $7.8m. The so-called ‘penalty’ was $200,000. So he's ended up gaining $7.6m. As usual, the rich get away with robbing the working class majority, because that’s why capitalism exists in the first place.

@andrewfinney79 Immediately after socialism replaces capitalism is obviously not going to be when socialism is at its best because all of the problems left behind capitalism must then be put right first, including increased house building and property renovations.

@gregorio_rojo If the global working class was free to go anywhere in the world to sell their labour it would probably have the effect of raising wages to some degree, but as there would still be a working class that had to work for an asset-owning employing class, capitalism would continue.
@ClaireBerlinski Just because a ruling elite put ‘Socialist’ in their name does not mean that must be what they were.

@vonderleyen To compete with America, China etc? Economic competition is not something that chiefly benefits the working class majority. Workers in all countries and economic blocs are exploited and deprived so capitalists take those profits. We do need to “act fast” — and replace capitalism!
@DebraMessing Mergers, monopolies and oligopolies are an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of competitive capitalism. In its artificial jungle, the most powerful and ruthless end up dominant. This is an inherent flaw in the capitalist system. Competition results in competition dying.

@AndrewCFollett Not so amazing is how you prefer to see this as a failure by the majority to achieve socialism, rather than a repulsive success by capitalists (with politicians, the state’s forces, MSM etc on their side) to maintain subjugation, exploitation and deprivation of the people.
@BernieSanders "Together we will end the corporate greed that is destroying lives..."

Only if we destroy and replace capitalism.
@kmwsoon "in the US we have outspoken socialist politicians"

Like who? Bernie? AOC? They are reformist politicians that support trying to improve capitalism as their priority — not socialists whose priority is capitalism being ended and replaced.
@kmwsoon "wouldn’t that suggest that a ruling class will always develop?"

No. It just shows that ruling classes don't like giving up power and privileges, and that people will have to unite and act politically if they to achieve a far better and just society.
Guess where and when this happened.

@CalebJHull As you ought to know, no population anywhere in the world has yet managed to escape from top-down control by a ruling class owning the industries, natural resources etc. Every country has an elite minority owning the means of production, so every country has a form of capitalism.

@DredWellsii @Ostrov_A A small amount of people refusing to contribute within genuine socialism won’t matter or be a hindrance when there is a clear majority willing to participate. The socialist society would be able to produce everything that’s needed, so any such minority would simply be ignored.
@horizonwords Just as capitalism is global now, so will socialism be too. Every country has an exploited and deprived working class majority, so every country’s population will come to want freedom from capitalist oppression and profiteering.

@buzz_ii $ won't exist anymore. What then matters is fully meeting needs.
@BlCoAp2018 @McAllisterDen That is absurd. The society will own the means of production and distribution, and a socialist population would be happy working in and with these, so the society would be provided with what it needs.
@hickey84x @McAllisterDen There would be no top-down government or ruling class whatsoever in a socialist class-free society. And the wealth (goods and services) would be distributed by working people in production workplaces, warehouses, transport networks etc.

@prageru @thewillwitt Che Guevara was a Leninist. Not a Marxist. Actual Marxists/socialists oppose all leadership and top-down control, whereas Che was an elitist who wrongly thought people had to be led into socialism due to not being intelligent enough to understand it and achieve it by themselves.
@Kristennetten It doesn't need to be violent at all. In fact, we advocate bringing about a change from capitalism to socialism simply by voting for it.
A second wave of Mad Cow Disease deaths is expected. The disease was caused after “farmers under pressure to produce beef quickly and cheaply had been adding the remains of cattle, sheep, pigs and chickens to their feed in the form of meat and bone meal.” https://t.co/BojBS5pD3J

@prageru The idiocy in this video is extraordinary. You have no idea what socialism is (a class-free state-free leader-free money-free society as described by Karl Marx). You even resort to linking socialism with the rightwing fascist Hitler. Don’t you know Nazis hated Marx and socialism? https://t.co/07x8aG5vkc

@RAG__JJ @MuneerKurdFeyli @BigJoeBastardi A 10-hour working week is the estimated average. People can work longer if they want to. And they cooperated to send human beings to the moon, not because they were “well paid”, but they wanted to achieve something never done before. It was about ambition — not making money.
@yaf Nonsense. If he turned against a "centrally-planned economy" he wasn't turning against Marxism since Marxist socialism/communism involves planning being undertaken by associated producers on local, regional and global levels. State capitalism is not the same thing as socialism.
@RAG__JJ @MuneerKurdFeyli @BigJoeBastardi How do you think humans walked on the moon without people ‘pulling together’? Yes it happened under capitalism, but engineers, scientists, mathematicians, programmers etc pulled together to accomplish something amazing — rather than make profits for an asset-owning master class.
@BigJoeBastardi Never heard of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, or the fact that socialism means a completely CLASS FREE society?! https://t.co/6wkyB9aRHq
@LibertarianSith @WhyAZ321 @richardbranson As there has never been a country with a class-free society where the population collectively owned the means of production and distribution, there has never been socialism, and therefore, socialism has killed no one. Now let’s take a look at what capitalism is responsible for. https://t.co/6Bjl5trymj
@richardbranson And then you remember that the outdated capitalist system you support is obsessed with profits and you have keep your gob shut until the appropriate patents or copyrights have been secured.
@truth_hurts_13 @Hrafn84 Because a clear majority would have brought about socialism. Try thinking about what that means, instead of idiotically suggesting all human beings are innately lazy and don't ever want to do any sort of work or help people.
@WSJopinion @HRaleighspeaks Socialism begins with a clear majority who know what it is and bring it about through political action. No country’s population has managed to acquire a socialist consciousness, break free from top-down rule and establish a class-free socialist society. Socialism hasn’t existed! https://t.co/5xzSOhRtmZ
@LazarchukPavlo Why wouldn’t small farmers — who enjoy farming — become socialists? They can continue living and working on their farms and no longer have all the financial struggles and problems that arise under capitalism. They would have the best machinery and workers to help them.
@LazarchukPavlo Never heard of elections?  1% against, and 99% for, means socialism is going to replace capitalism.
@ForIn2020 @TonyHighman1 Unfortunately, you don’t. https://t.co/BD8J1xkv8C
@JerseyMike82 What’s shameful is you don’t understand why it is.
@TonyHighman1 You’re thinking of capitalism. https://t.co/cC0U1Zu9Jx
@elonmusk “There are but three ways for people to escape their wretched lot. The first is via the liquor-store, the second is the path of the temple; but the third is by way of the social revolution.” – Bakunin

Bad news for capitalists like you.
@AssiSousana @dcopaken @davidgraeber Try our education section before assuming you know more about economics than others. https://t.co/tXKOOJdwQ9
@EssexCanning Please don’t call Labour members “socialists”, when their main objective is to take over political management of the profit-driven capitalist economy from the Tories and tinker with it. The objective of socialists is to end capitalism asap and replace it with actual socialism.
@FriedrichHayek "Socialists have been selling the the earthly pursuit of socialism on earth as a replacement for the pursuit of perfection in heaven after death"

False! Socialists have been selling the the earthly pursuit of socialism as a replacement for death-inflicting capitalism. https://t.co/ABVv9Ryu0n
@Hrafn84 Free home; free public and personal transport; free shopping; free electricity, gas, internet connection, mobile phone service; free clothing; free footwear; free top-quality medical and dental care; no more money worries; no more burglaries or robberies; no wars. And much more.
@yefeth "The socialist will have victory over us if we don't stop ignorant behavior"

Victory for us then.
@jonathanvswan Capitalist-owned newspapers are not going to be allowed to promote socialism if the boss(es) doesn’t like it. And by "socialists", the writer no doubt means leftists, who merely favor trying to reform capitalism, instead of ending and replacing it.
@dcopaken @davidgraeber It’s why we say socialism will be far more efficient and productive than outdated backward capitalism. https://t.co/lghIntEkAd
@Hrafn84 The average working week is going to be far shorter than now without millions of useless jobs only required under capitalism. Automation, robotics, AI, high speed internet etc will further reduce the need for human labour. There’ll be more than enough people to do necessary jobs.
@o_StunnaMan_x Leftist reforms under a capitalist economy are not socialism. Never have been. Never will be. The fact you repeatedly choose to ignore this fact suggests you are a troll.
@Hrafn84 If you could do any job you wanted to (after necessary training, if required), what would you really like to do?
@patel4witham "the evils of socialism &amp; communism"

The Soviet Union had state capitalism — never socialism/communism. What a shame Thatcher was too ignorant to know the difference. https://t.co/qiVrHbhQZo

Did bankers say trillions in bailouts was “socialism”?

Do bosses of fossil fuel companies call trillions in subsidies they get “socialism”?

Do farmers given billions in subsidies say it’s “socialism”?

But health care, social security, taxes... “SOCIALISM!”*

(*Leftism really). https://t.co/smMzsQCQ1P
@RealDrGina Again. Socialism means a society where money has become completely obsolete. Stop saying “socialism” when you actually mean leftism or statism. https://t.co/OjHQvc5prw
