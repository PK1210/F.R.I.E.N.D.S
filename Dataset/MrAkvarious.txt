Manoj Pahwa is just magic. Seems @anubhavsinha brings out the best in him. I'm rather honoured to know (and have worked with) Kumud Mishra and Shubhrajyoti Barat. But moment of chest thumping pride was when @_SlowCheeta_ showed up in the end to drive the point of the film home.
Also, what is that ensemble? @ayushmannk delivers a pitch perfect performance and leads such a terrific cast. Right down to the briefest of appearances. Full marks for casting. And full marks to each and every actor. @Ashishsverma
@Mdzeeshanayyub @sayanigupta
Article 15 is outstanding. Hats off to @anubhavsinha for following the well deserved acclaim and success of Mulk with another solid film. Important, thought provoking, even witty on occasion. And some of those scenes are so bloody well written.
