@RajeshNarredu @bssm @Reddysharan I’m just saying that the JAI can’t resort to blackmail
@RajeshNarredu @bssm @Reddysharan The merit of the decision is not the issue here. The BTC has to abide by Mysore’s decision whether right or wrong
@Reddysharan BTC should take a leaf out of what the management did in 1978 and conduct racing without them, with apprentices because this is blackmail by the Jockey’s Association
@Reddysharan This is wrong of the JAI, BTC has nothing to do with Mysor’s suspension of the jockey but as a member of TAI they are bound to reciprocate the punishment whether right or wrong

Bigger problem; a 0-20 is a Fifth of the Stakes and there’s 2 or 3 of these races every week. It’s pretty obvious that our administrators have their priorities set towards the lower end of the sport. We need massive restructuring and less racedays nationwide in these tough times https://t.co/V39HOz0Ybd

@harshitbajpai_ @shivens But my opinion is my opinion QED!
@harshitbajpai_ @shivens I’ve been hauled up in front of the stewards at a certain club once before for speaking my mind
@shivens Further questions should be asked as to how the handicapper has let the connections give it runs to bring the rating from a high of 70 to 31.
@shivens Just checked it out, 7 year old horse hasn’t won since October 2016, the horse broke down and was euthanized.
