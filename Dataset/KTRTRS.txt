Let me remind FM @nsitharaman Ji of Hon‚Äôble PM‚Äôs comments from back when he was CM of Gujaratüëá

#UnionBudget2019 üëé https://t.co/eAdwrPJxnx
3 important sectors for Telangana; Life sciences &amp; Pharma, Information Technology &amp; Textiles

No support for Kakatiya Mega Textile park, not even a mention of ITIR for Hyderabad &amp; zero support for pharmaceutical &amp; life sciences sector where Hyderabad is a Hub

#UnionBudget2019 üëé
Even after 5 years of formation of Telangana, no mention of the AP Bifurcation Act promises; integrated steel plant at Bayyaram, Rail Coach factory at Warangal, Tribal University etc

Why this indifference to a promising young state FM @nsitharaman Ji?

#UnionBudget2019 üëé
Telangana state has repeatedly demanded national project status for either Kaleshwaram or Palamuru lift irrigation project on various forums. No mention or even acknowledgement 

Are Telangana‚Äôs projects not in the interest of our nation FM @nsitharaman Ji??

#UnionBudget2019 üëé
Niti Aayog lauds Mission Kakatiya (lake restoration &amp; strengthening) &amp; Mission Bhagiratha (Drinking water Grid) &amp; recommends to Govt of India to allocate ‚Çπ24,000 Cr to these two schemes of Telangana 

Strangely, Not even ‚Çπ24 allocated by FM @nsitharaman Ji 
#UnionBudget2019 üëé
Extremely disappointing &amp; insipid union budget from Telangana‚Äôs perspective. Economic survey praises Telangana‚Äôs initiatives but FM @nsitharaman Ji completely ignores a performing state‚Äôs requests for support
