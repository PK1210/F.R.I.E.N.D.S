Earlier, evening shift schools (mostly boys schools) would be neglected by the system. After a focused intervention in these schools, there has been a remarkable improvement in the pass percentage from 83% to almost 90% this year.

17,000 additional students appeared for the exam this year, but the number of schools with 100% pass percentage went up from 168 in 2018 to 203 in 2019.
