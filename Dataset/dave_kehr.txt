@j_christley Fox destroyed their Technicolor 3-strip negatives in the 1970s, when they copied them to an inferior single strip stock called CRI, which then turned out to have serious fading issues. The only way to reclaim the color now is to re-colorize them digitally, which is costly.

Pauline Kael's thoughts on LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME haven't aged well: "Day is a little less butch than usual . . . yet your sympathy may go out to the scummy little guy beating her up."
I remember when the BFI published a dossier titled MOVE OVER MISCONCEPTIONS: DORIS DAY REAPPRAISED in 1980, to the general shock and outrage of the film intelligentsia.  Its insights, of course, are now commonplace but it took a lot of guts at the time.
