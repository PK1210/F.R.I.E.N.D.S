I‚Äôm goosing myself to go in early and snatch it up before anyone finds it ... The first third of it is pretty good but the rest is a jiggling pile of poo and I would really prefer it not be seen (especially by day-job colleagues, but really anyone).
Before I went home last night, I printed last weekend‚Äôs draft of a story so I could work on it by hand. (I haven‚Äôt got a printer at home.) Then I forgot and left it sitting on the printer. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@TheRestlessQuil It took me a while but what I got out of it was learning strategies to take advantage of my strengths rather than endlessly berating myself into paralysis and misery for my weaknesses.
@tafebellangere @ninaberries I would like to read this but I really don‚Äôt want to hate Jane Eyre!
@ninaberries Elizabeth Wein‚Äôs The Pearl Thief is a cute prequel to Code Name Verity. Not as astonishing as the latter (few books are) but it has some depth to it and some poignancy given what happens to the character later
@Fritinancy Here is an opposite sort of scenario: When I was in eighth grade or so, I thought I heard a kid say he was preparing for a debate on "youth in Asia". I either had never encountered "euthanasia," or I had no idea how to pronounce it.
