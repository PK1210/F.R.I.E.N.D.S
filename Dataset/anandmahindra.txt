It was a great pleasure to meet you @SecPompeo There was a phrase you used which we can hang our hats on: ‚ÄòOur (India-U.S) relationship is based on Values.‚Äô https://t.co/CeZhTTvwh8
The 1st interaction of our new foreign minister with an overseas counterpart. Worth a watch. Both @DrSJaishankar &amp; @SecPompeo  displayed maturity &amp; balance &amp; exuded quiet confidence. A benchmark for how India &amp; the U.S should interact.

I view this as a strong signal of the new administration‚Äôs  intent to retain energetic, visionary and business-friendly voices.  @amitabhk87 you‚Äôve always put your nation 1st &amp; your optimism about India‚Äôs future is infectious.

With rising trade tensions between China &amp; the rest of the world as well as rising wages in China, there‚Äôs a historic opportunity for India to become a magnet for export-oriented businesses. Niti Aayog had promoted the idea of two large coastal economic zones(east &amp; west) (1/2)
A perfect time to establish those zones &amp; make them benchmarks for the ease of doing business. In fact China‚Äôs reforms began by creating SEZs that experimented with a business-friendly environment.Also a sound way to ignite growth via large Make-in-India investments (2/2)
