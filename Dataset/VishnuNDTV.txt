@Iyervval @bennedose @YusufDFI @arnabmit @RupakChatto Sadly though, the quality of debate on BR still primarily remains 'its my way or the highway.' To me this means a very closed group, one that is v different from what it was meant to be. Cheers.
@Iyervval @bennedose @YusufDFI @arnabmit @RupakChatto 7. I mentioned my concerns on personal attacks and some of these other points to some of the mods and explained how the forum had potentially opened itself up for legal action from those who were being commented on. They agreed.
@Iyervval @bennedose @YusufDFI @arnabmit @RupakChatto 6.  Many other sub forums which spawned within the main group never stuck to the main theme of national defence and I personally felt BR became too unwieldy ...
@Iyervval @bennedose @YusufDFI @arnabmit @RupakChatto 5.  It is sad that many key posters on BRF over some time began spewing hate on others who had different views, ascribing motives and effectively and politicising a forum meant exclusively for debate on defence and security.
@Iyervval @bennedose @YusufDFI @arnabmit @RupakChatto 4.  BR became a superb resource for those into Indian defence as did the BRF forum that came along after some time.
@Iyervval @bennedose @YusufDFI @arnabmit @RupakChatto 3.  Somewhere down the road, Rupak's IAF page metamorphosed into BR with Rupak and subsequently some other WONDERFUL mods as its curators.
@Iyervval @bennedose @YusufDFI @arnabmit @RupakChatto 2.  I finished my MA and returned to India in 96, Rupak by then had made Rupak's IAF page, a wonderful resource I felt proud to have been associated with.
@Iyervval @bennedose @YusufDFI @arnabmit @RupakChatto 1.  Abhijit, here is a story for you ... Sometime in 1994, Rupak and I were students in Ottawa - he was doing his Masters at Ottawa U, I was pursuing mine at Carleton. It was Rupak's idea to set up India's first IAF page.

1/. Further to my last tweet on Captain Kalpana Kundu - this is what a Long Range Patrol of the Indian Army means: it can last a month to 40 days, soldiers may have to carry all their rations, porters may or may not accompany them.

Captain Kalpana Kundu, a Medical Officer of the Army packs some serious josh. She just completed an extremely challenging high altitude patrol along the China frontier in Arunachal tending to the medical needs of our soldiers deployed out on the front. https://t.co/wybm6vluiC
