@iamshorgo @sudhadudley Maybe you need to know me! By the way, the boundaries rule has been in place for a long time. It isn't 'fine print'. It's been used in the IPL.
@sudhadudley Yes. If we had all agreed to the rules, yes.
Many intelligent and sensible people are throwing up widely differing solutions. Tells you how difficult it is to find one that everyone agrees upon!
@suhel But the teams had agreed that it would be that way!

@bks89 Correct!
There are many imponderables, many human frailties at work in sport. But that is how we play it.Everyone sits together,accepts the rules &amp; within them,somebody wins. This final has thrown up a certain kind of result. When emotions calm down,we can see if there is something better
We accept so many things within a game. An lbw verdict where a projected path (a fine approximation but still an approximation!) determines that 48% of a ball was hitting a stump and not 51%. Remember these rules came out of the same process you will now subject this game too.
Could it be decided by the no of wickets lost? Would that reduce flair and risk-taking? Could it be decided by no of runs minus extras? Does that paper over some deficiencies? Should a cricket match have joint winners if a super over is tied?
Should the final of Wimbledon be decided by a tie-breaker? Should the final of a World Cup be decided by who scores more penalties? There are pluses and minuses with every system but teams and players are shown these and they agree to play within them.
The counting of boundaries is not a new rule. It has been there for a long time. Remember, before the Super Over, World T20 games were won with players bowling to unguarded stumps!
Maybe it is time to have a discussion over the playing conditions. But remember when the teams are asked if they want any changes, they accept the rules as they are.
The easiest thing in the world is to rant about the rules. The most inconvenient thing is to subject your rant to the same rigour you expect from the rule.
@scottbstyris @ICC Just curious. How would you have resolved it Scotty? Another super-over? No of wickets? Shared?
@greatbong @vivekiyer20 Agree on the connotation but the originally meaning is still to 'steal a glance', isn't it?
@greatbong @vivekiyer20 "Bhogle using it" doesn't necessarily mean it has to be correct! You recommend "peek into the future" then? But a peep originally meant a glance. Did the association come up later, you think?

This World Cup showed that, like life, sport throws up the unexpected and baffles us too. Bowlers returned, totals shrunk, batsmen grafted, spinners had to earn wickets and so, struggled, 250 was a very good score. Humility &amp; tenacity were rewarded. It was a magnificent spectacle
My heart goes out to Kane Williamson and @BLACKCAPS. But congratulations for playing with dignity and class. You made a lot more friends and did your country proud.

The pre-tournament favourites won it. England have played outstanding cricket over the last few overs and this will go a long way in the growth of white ball cricket there.
England cap a phenomenal turnaround from 2015.
Run-out off the last ball! There will never be another World Cup final like this.
That catch. Then 15 from 4 balls and the fortuitous six. Trent Boult must wonder what cards life is dealing him.
Super Over. Tie-breaker. Find me something, anything, that can come close to challenging live sport
RT @chinmaybhogle: You've got to be kidding me. #WorldCupfinal
Stokes, born in New Zealand, against New Zealand. This is redemption for the World T20 if ever it was possible
Stokes and the last over! And Boult to correct his error. The last over of the best World Cup final.
Two cliffhangers in one day. Who would have thought!
Oh Federer, even the greatest feel the pressure...
This is an excellent partnership. No nerves. Not taking chances. Perfect for England.
Djokovic and England staging comebacks......
Don't think this is an easy track. If anything getting tougher. New Zealand are onto something big here.
What a spell from Matt Henry. And the figures are unkind to Boult. Now, different challenge for New Zealand with the ball a bit older
That was the closest umpire's call you would see. It was millimetres away from a first ball wicket.
The first ten overs the key. New Zealand want wickets, England tend to go hard. Big session
So how good is this New Zealand total? On @cricbuzz with  @ImZaheer and @robbieuthappa as soon as the last ball is bowled.
It's been that kind of tournament. You can start with aggressive intent but power play scores remain around the same.

@TomMoodyCricket Good call too
It is convention to give the player of the match award to someone from the winning side. Matt Henry was fantastic today but the performance of the match came from Ravindra Jadeja. He is my player of the match.
Well done India fans. You lit up this World Cup. It would have been a lesser event without you.
Well played New Zealand. You always punch above your weight in World Cups and that is why you are such an admired side around the world. Much respect.
Once again. 2015. 2017. 2019. Impressive India fall in the pressure game.
Valiant innings. A rare run-out in his last innings in a World Cup match.
Fabulous innings from Jadeja. If hope flickers, it is because of him. He's had a great match
Will Dhoni play the big shots now?
Super over https://t.co/gmUTxs5Nke
Are we onto something here?
Nails left, anyone?
I don't know how far this innings is going but Jadeja has played the innings of his life. And put a bit of pressure back on New Zealand
Partnership 53. Still a long way off but happy to see the approach. Since he bats in the top order in Ranji Trophy cricket, Jadeja thinks like a batsman.
Oh, Rishabh, patience throws up many opportunities. Was such a good innings till then.
We came to the World Cup thinking we are going to see long T20 games, with scores around 350. Instead, we have seen short test matches. It has played out so differently , so fascinatingly
Dhoni? Injured? Should be here otherwise.
We've seen some great catches in this tournament but that from Neesham was the best
This was the nightmare scenario for India. Now is the time for a good batting side to show its depth.
Watching Jadeja in the field is such a thrill. Best in the game today.
New Zealand's first target would have been 240. Would have liked 250. It is a tricky score given the pressures of a World Cup semi-final but India will be the happier side at this stage.
@ManishPajan You have the academic credentials to understand it. Give it a shot. You would have studied fairly complex algorithms.
I understand the logic, not the mathematics. It is not difficult. https://t.co/x8SSxJmQkR
@krish_ramkumar @SudarshanEMA @ICC Once India begin their reply, their D/L par score after 20 overs will be around 60-70 for no loss on the same principle.
A very happy 70th to the great #SunilGavaskar. I use to switch the radio off if you got out. Wish you great health and many more years in the game you have so embellished.
@krish_ramkumar @SudarshanEMA @ICC It is fair. The no is higher because you have ten wickets in hand.
