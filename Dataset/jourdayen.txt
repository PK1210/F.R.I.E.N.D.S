@theestallion have you watched samurai champloo
anyway, it was a really engrossing read. I can't say I enjoy the ending, but the journey was exhilarating. and, in my opinion, quin doesn't see women as people and margot can't accept that because it would crush her. she attaches her self-worth to quin. it's quite sad.
these situations that are being highlighted in our culture right now are workplace situations. and yes, if you work with someone, what you do outside of work w/ them also counts as a workplace situation. it's frankly embarrassing that we're just getting around to accepting this.
as someone who writes erotica, I've spent A LOT of time thinking about sexual freedom, flirting and desire and how that has changed over time and I've concluded that thinking a raised awareness of consent is going to make life less sexy is... very very childish.
I do think that gaitskill, like a lot of women 37+, has taken internet culture and criticism way too seriously. an online petition wouldn't ruin a veteran publisher's career. that's a really silly notion that a lot of people have right now. I'm not sure what to do about it.
but as a millennial woman, I don't really struggle with those questions as much. we've spent too much time discussing how a guy being nice and having the capacity to love doesn't diminish his capacity for abuse. however, I've had the benefit of learning that early in my life.
in a way, margot is a fantastic portrait of a woman who is struggling with the idea that a dear friend of hers who looked after her so tenderly could be seen as an abuser.
I tend not to put much stock in the way older women respond to #metoo. there's a language barrier between my generation of women and theirs, and that misunderstanding doesn't always denote malicious intent.
been thinking quite a bit about the gaitskill new yorker story and how your interpretation of the author's intention affects the way you receive it

the weirdest thing about people complaining about this piece is that there’s really only one piece like it—I think it was written for bustle around the time the first season dropped.
