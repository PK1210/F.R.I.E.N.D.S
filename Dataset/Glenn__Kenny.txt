@aagave LOL, have a blessed day
@aagave There’s nothing the least bit rebellious about “Airplane!” Its whole mode of humor is white middle class collegiate. Its format is a mild leftward shift from Mel Brooks and the Marx and Ritz Brothers that never comes within swinging distance of “Hellzapoppin’!”

@jmguardia You think this is what a grown man does? Go online and call strangers “moronic,” “pathetic,” “idiot,” and  beat your chest in triumph because you have “unmasked” them? Are you 12 years old? Do your friends and family know what you are? Does this help you be an entrepreneur?
@Madmaddingcrowd They’re about neck and neck for me but yeah. Martin Amis has a good phrase for the tone: “giggly viciousness.” (Which he coined, I think writing about Tarantino. Or his own early work. I forget which.)

Some of the reaction to this @decider piece has been revelatory. People get reflexively hostile just because of “Airplane!” being submitted to any kind of inquiry. And start frothing about “cancel” and “PC,” which terms aren’t in the piece. https://t.co/C1mQCaxf1t

@adambonin Yeah, in retrospect I should have found room to work that in. It’s both an offensive trope and the most poorly executed gag in the movie.
@scottrenshaw Glad you noticed.
@adambonin Yes indeed. There’s more after that as well. 70s-80s comedies and beyond are rife with such cases.
@spudsfan Space issue. It wasn’t that I didn’t notice him!
@adambonin I could have gone on longer—both items were in my notes—but I was disinclined to make the piece too baggy. I believe Stucker’s stuff, similar to the “jive” speakers, was (for better or worse) derived from bits he himself developed.
