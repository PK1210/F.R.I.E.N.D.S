@t1tmouse Fire away! :) I use it rarely; either when I've got velcro rollers in my hair for delicious '70s-era Jane Fonda volume, or when I've got chemicals in my hair requiring heat .
So by all means, get pissed. The shit they've had to put up with is unacceptable and worthy of our outrage. But let's make sure we're aiming our cannons in the right direction. And for the love of fuck, stop throwing the word "censorship" around. That isn't what this is.
This is unfortunate but also not at all surprising to me. The amount of vitriolic criticism these women endure online is astonishing. In all my years as editor here, I've never received as much flak for a cover story as the one I ran on them. It's sheer misogyny and nothing more.
Regarding the Soska sisters and #Rabidgate: I love me some internet outrage as much as the next guy, but the fact that the Soskas were dinged for an image that many of us have posted without incident means that they were likely reported to Twitter by someone. (thread)
