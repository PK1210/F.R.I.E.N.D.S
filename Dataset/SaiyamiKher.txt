Tsitsipas, Zverev, Venus, Osaka all out in the 1st round! Was quite an upsetting 1st day at Wimbledon! 
I want #Federer to play for the next 20yrs, if he doesn’t then had great hopes in Zverev &amp; Tsitsipas. 

Wonder who’s going to take over from Fed, Djo &amp; Nadal?

#Wimbledon
Good luck #MayankAgarwal - long long over due. Prolific domestic record &amp; now an ODI debut at the WC. 
Bad luck #AjinkyaRahane - currently playing in English conditions. An ODI batting average of 45 in the last 15 innings (1 x 100, 7 x 50’s)
