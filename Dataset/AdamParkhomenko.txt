Trump is a racist and criminal. We’ve always known it, but anyone denying either after this week, is either willfully blind, also a racist and a criminal, a member of the Trump family or all of the above.
called for a “final solution” for Muslims and called a black man a “jigga-boo.” But Trump also tagged Kanye in a tweet and said he’s trying to help A$AP Rocky  get out of a Swedish jail cell so he gave Fox and Diamond and Silk enough to say he’s basically the next Mandela.
On Saturday morning, Trump continued to show us how not-racist he is by repeatedly retweeting internationally-known super racist Katie Hopkins, who said Jews were to blame for the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting because they support immigration, who is banned from South Africa,
Kanye won’t save you: Trump reversed his disavowal of the “Send her back!” chants Friday, spreading more lies and conspiracy theories about the squad and defending the offensive chant as just patriotic people doing their thang.
@PGuarasci @cam_joseph @DNC @RNC I won’t even get into the specifics right now about being asked to pull myself off the ballot during the elections in exchange for a voice as the Party moved forward. I’ll leave it at that for today. /4
@PGuarasci @cam_joseph @DNC @RNC I have very specific issues with the way Tom Perez runs the DNC and what I have continued NOT to see from this DNC. Once again, I am impressed with a number of the members of the comms team, but it’s clear in my opinion there is a fundamental leadership problem. 3/
@PGuarasci @cam_joseph @DNC @RNC There are some great staffers in that building, especially on the comms/rapid response/War Room team. But I have reached out to Tom, Mary Beth and others on different things and that has gone unanswered. Winning is about addition and not subtraction. 2/
@PGuarasci @cam_joseph @DNC @RNC I ran for Vice Chair of the DNC. With all due respect, Tom Perez has never once reached out to me. He did take just about every single other person who ran and put them on his transition team, made them a DNC member, etc etc. 1/
@PGuarasci @cam_joseph @DNC @RNC FWIW, money is just one piece of this. I think Tom Perez is just not where we need to be when it comes to who is Party chair at this point. I would rather see that change now and not during a convention again.
As Cummings notes in his letter, this would be the SECOND time Trump escaped indictment because of this ridiculous policy. In the meantime, Bill Barr.
https://t.co/r2IGjBelgX
That’s what House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings wants to know. In a letter to SDNY, Cummings asked if Trump was let off the hook because of the old DOJ policy of not indicting a sitting president.
Explanation required: It seems pretty damn obvious from docs released this week that Trump was quite involved with Michael Cohen’s efforts to buy the silence of women Trump had affairs with. So why the hell did he walk?
Obama should’ve just called some of these morons enemies of the people and they would’ve been falling all over themselves to kiss his ass. https://t.co/Bc1U6CcYTc
There’s nothing stopping Tiffany Trump from speaking out against the violence her father is inciting against female members of Congress too. You might forget about her but let’s not forget this either.

It took unimaginable courage to come forward and tell the world about what a monster Trump is, and it is a stain on this country that their stories have been forgotten or dismissed. Credit to CNN for remembering and telling their stories.

A broken clock: After a week of just horrendous editorial decisions, CNN went and completely redeemed themselves (h/t Dumb and Dumber) by running a feature on the “forgotten women” of the #MeToo movement: Trump’s accusers.
There are 472 days until the presidential election. Trump continues his racist tirade with a timeout to tell us he has a black friend, CNN does something good despite a disastrous week and Elijah Cummings wants to know why SDNY let Trump off the hook.

These are the really scary times, folks. Let’s not be naive about what’s happening, what we’re fighting or what it will take to win.
House Democrats, unify around these women. Lift them up, rally around them and let’s show the world that America is better than what it’s seeing right now.
Capitol Hill Republicans alternated between claiming ignorance, defending Trump or attacking the squad and then condemning the chants. Mitch McConnell said on Fox he thinks Trump is “on to something.”
For the last few years, the racism, the lies and the incitement have been normalized. But last night was a stark reminder that there is a white supremacist in the White House pushing white supremacist policies and he does not care if someone gets hurt or killed.
Grand Dragon-in-chief:
It was perhaps the most chilling scene in modern American politics: The president of the United States, lying about a Democratic freshwoman’s support of al Qaeda and thousands of North Carolinians chanting “Send her back!”
As much as we love teeing off on little Randy Paul, a man who got absolutely fucked up by a senior citizen, we have to defer to Jon Stewart here: https://t.co/jvkvSh2Hkf
But you can always bet on Rand Paul to be a little shit, and on Wednesday he didn’t disappoint as he blocked Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s efforts to pass the 9/11 first responders bill.
Russia Rand: Consider us shocked that the little fella who couldn’t defend his front yard from an attack by Wilford Brimley is trying to screw over the heroes of 9/11.
