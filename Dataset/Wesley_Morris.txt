By the way, who wants to be the one to break it to Carol Burnett that her show's not even in reruns anymore?
Justin Hurwitz wins the music score award, thus kicking off THE RESURGENCE OF FIRST MAN. Right?
("So here's to reruns and YouTube," side-eyes Carol Burnett, on how no network would ever put her show on TV now.)
Watching three minutes of Carol Burnett clips (especially tonight!) makes whatever she did for us ‚Äì *to* us ‚Äì seem like a criminally endangered natural resource. Don't frack her!
So you know how some awards show host deliver pizzas to the audience or bus in tourists? Samberg and Oh just brought out people in lab coats to dispense flu shots. Do they know their room? I'm pretty sure that's not the shot it needs.
Jamie Lee Curtis is also cold-*looking* tonight. We need that movie now.
Jamie Lee Curtis is cold. She just pretended not to be married to a director in order to shade Ben Stiller for being a director.
Disliking something determined to be this nice for actually being this nice feels ungrateful. But I'm watching a TV show, which can be nice *and* great, but everybody seems happy to just be, like, there, alive. Which, if you think about the world beyond that room, does feel fair.
So The Americans ‚Äì an eerily clairvoyant Russian-spy drama-thriller ‚Äì just accepted its last ever prize with the equivalent of a hug. Samberg and Oh are winning. The show meanwhile...
Maybe the fund is to get the 2020 Golden Globes back to TBS where you could drink your way through not having gone to rehearsal.
