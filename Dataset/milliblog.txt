9/9 Padara Padara (Devi Sri Prasad) as Anil drops his eggy concoction. Is this some implicit assumption that Telugu film music is more established than Marathi, giving them 3 full songs in their ad? It need not be like that, no?
8/9 played is from Dhadak, and not Sairat :)

In the Telugu version, the playlist is called 'Top Hits - Telugu' and is playing Radhan-composed 'Undiporaadhey' (from Hushaaru) first, Rowdy Baby's Telugu version next (Yuvan Shankar Raja, Maari 2) and Maharshi's https://t.co/yOw5WFEvna
7/9 his eggs concoction. I'd have loved to see Marathi songs being used across all 3 - it's not as if Marathi films don't have good music - they have tremendous music and Zingaat, the 3rd used in the mix is testimony to that, though I have a feeling the one that is being https://t.co/26fWJQstvn
6/9 breakfast (eggs). The Hindi and Marathi versions feature Tanishk Bagchi-composed Ve Maahi as the song being played first in the playlist called 'Bollywood Butter'. Then, Mere Gully Mein from Gully Boy (DIVINE, Naezy &amp; Sez on the beat) and eventually Zingaat, as Anil drops https://t.co/rDmviHDyKJ
5/9 those songs in the Hindi and Marathi versions), that Gaana is usually accused to indulging in (and succeeding, given the wide influence of Punjabi music across India). 

Things are slightly better in the other series featuring Anil Kapoor and Ishaan where Anil is making
4/9 Jersey (the 2 songs shown in the playlist are Spirit of Jersey and Adhento Gaani Vunnapaatuga), the recent Telugu film with excellent music by Anirudh Ravichander. I wonder why Spotify is aggravating the already common annoyance of Punjabification of everything (by showing https://t.co/rf1r0XfPlO
3/9 However, interestingly, the Marathi version of the ad doesn't have any Marathi songs and merely uses the Hindi ad's playlist as-is, featuring a Punjabi song and the next song being a Telugu song. Even more interesting - the Telugu version of the same ad has a playlist from https://t.co/EYoIA1QLqS
2/9 Telugu film Baadshah! While Thaman's music is excellent and the song is a great listen too, I don't know how many 'North Indians' would naturally or consciously put this in a 'Daler Mehndi' playlist. Is this Spotify's idea of national integration? If it works, damn good :)
Spotify India has a new campaign featuring Anil Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter. The one with them playing tennis is (so far) available in 3 languages. In the Hindi version, they are listening to a Daler Mehndi playlist in which the next song is Banthi Poola Janaki, from the 2013 1/9 https://t.co/qBlJka0cjQ

@subhajrao Yes, indeed :) The human delay was beyond our control, literally dictated by nature and time. This one, even when digital and needs a switch on-off, is purely operational and a human failing in the back-end.
@subhajrao Oh damn it - sorry :) Wrong thread :)
@kcgadiyar The (human) ignorance lies here: "The animals we recreated to make them seem realistic are not entertaining enough". If they are realistic, that's a different yardstick, from animated, anthropomorphized creations.
It was no different in 'pada potti' times too. Remember Aan Paavam's extended introduction scene? The 'potti' almost didn't make it, after going through multiple terrains :) https://t.co/h8LUsGN0UN
@kcgadiyar As I said, they are not remade for the sake of comparison - justified or not, they remain in our heads. All I'm saying is this line of comparison is unfair and based on our stupendous ignorance.
@kcgadiyar Oh no - nobody remakes things for people to compare. They make it for a newer audience and to make a profit. The comparison is in our heads.
@kcgadiyar Calling it an abomination, in comparison, using our ignorant and limited pov is what I'm referring to as unfair. That they are not meant for comparison at all.
@kcgadiyar 'Stoic stare' is merely the human interpretation of it, from our horrendously ignorant, self-centered and limited point of view :)
@kcgadiyar Of course, it is a movie, made for human entertainment, seen only from our point of view. When animated, we take extreme liberty to convert animals to display human emotions. Now, when showing them 'realistically' how is it fair to expect to continue to display that?
Isn't this comparison mighty unfair? The original was animation, so we anthropomorphized the hell out of animals to suit human story-telling needs. Now, when the animals are presented in their real selves, shouldn't we make an attempt to look beyond ourselves and see them as-is? https://t.co/ubikbv2vXD

@othlaw Considering Tanishk Bagchi is a Hindi composer (primarily, and Dhvani is also a Hindi singer first), chances are they would have composed it first in Hindi and recorded the Hindi version first.
5/5 for Hindi). This is an interesting trend that I also noticed partly for Saaho - the song Psycho Saiyaan had the same female singer for Hindi, Tamil &amp; Telugu - Dhvani Bhanushali. Anirudh joined her for Tamil and Telugu, while Sachet Tandon was the male singer in Hindi.
4/5 The other interesting part is that Sanjith has sung this song in all the 5 languages this movie is releasing in - Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu &amp; Malayalam. The first song from Pehlwaan was also sung by the same singer in all 5 languages - Vyas Raj (Dev Negi joined him only

@BornToWhine Ideally, Zee Music should have added that note under the video.
@_harshdeep @ZeeMusicCompany @tanishkbagchi That's completely unfair and a sweeping conclusion. Tanishk has some really good original songs to his credit. Shubh Mangal Saavdhan's Kanha and Kankad (with Vayu), for instance. Or the Telugu song from Lover - Adbutham.
@taparam Aah ok :) I don't know who owns the original :) Surinder's may be just a version she has sung.
@taparam That wasn't my point. It wasn't to credit Surinder Kaur in isolation/particular. Just the fact that it was based on a folk song. Many other songs have been credited as such in the past.
PS: Gotto know about this from a comment in my blog https://t.co/2CYAb24YBf
3/3 And Sanu Kehndi, for context: https://t.co/guBb96CO0x
2/3 As for the recreation itself, Tanishk samples a small part of the original as-is, and produces a really zingy new version that uses the original's core tune, but definitely stands on its own. The original: Surinder Kaur- Bhabo Kehndi Eh https://t.co/15MHEaT0l9
I had no clue Kesari's Sanu Kehndi was a recreation of a Punjabi folk song! @ZeeMusicCompany credits only @tanishkbagchi as the composer and doesn't have any details on the original, or even mention that it is adapted from an original. This is clearly unfair. 1/3 https://t.co/SS7QFlOSvY

@GuitarBollywood That's true. I was just pointing to 2 perspectives, when you see it from the global view and within-India view. :)
@GuitarBollywood I wouldn't say it's necessarily a welcome change. While I love the fact that we also have non-film music, we could also look at our film music as a pioneer different from other countries where it lags significantly behind non-film music. Film music is our innovation.

Continuing this thread: Beyond the list of films in the 2 tweets above, this one takes the cake and the bakery! A Malayalam film called, "And the Oskar Goes To..."!!

8/8 director Bala, but in a Morgan Creek-like move, the producers, E4 Entertainment didn't like that version. They have roped in a debutant director, Gireesaaya, to direct the same script again, starring Dhruv! I hope Bala's version also gets a release - at least on OTT/TV.
7/8 Schrader's version and that received slightly better critical reception than Harlin's earlier version!

So, I think there is hope! Even as Arjun Reddy's Hindi version (Kabir Singh) is due for release, the Tamil remake, starring Vikram's son Dhruv was completed by
6/8 released, it was a commercial and critical bomb. That's when Morgan Creek decided to recoup some of their double-investment and offered $35,000 and a very short amount of time for Paul Schrader to finish his version! 

Then Morgan Creek got Warner Bros. to release
5/8 and Die Hard 2 fame) to 'retool' the film. Renny's film had almost the same plot points, same lead actor, same locations and sets as the original production, but with a dramatically different, more explicit horror tone.

4/8 to release it (because it was more cerebral than scary, according to him). But, because the intellectual property was valuable, he wasn’t going to shelve the movie. So he made other plans. Morgan Creek roped in director Renny Harlin (of Deep Blue Sea, Cliffhanger
3/8 signed on to direct the film, featuring Stellan Skarsgård as Father Lankester Merrin, by Morgan Creek films. 

When James Robinson, owner of Morgan Creek, saw the cut of Paul Schrader’s film, called 'Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist', he said outright that he wasn’t going https://t.co/CGNCNNMmC9
2/8 After declining that ask with, 'Not only do I not want to do that, I don’t think the world needs another one of those', he did change his mind and writing a script for the new Exorcist film (which would be a prequel to the earlier stories), writer/director Paul Schrader was

RT @milliblog: Surprisingly illuminating interview with Vijay Antony, by @baradwajrangan  https://t.co/fYqHh551pB 

'Surprisingly' because…
@_tharkuri Burst out laughing at that line :)
"(Vijay) Antony’s range of expressions is like a reverse akshaya patram — an empty vessel that viewers themselves can fill with whatever they want, because he’s been repeatedly telling us that he doesn’t know how to act." — @_tharkuri's Kolaigaran review https://t.co/uSAXND2pO5
@GuitarBollywood @phanishankar @VHSwaala @RujD_MusicMstni @mpmainka @Karaboondi @silverlightgal @ShiivZ @vip_nair @taparam @p1j @FagunB @parikhm Done. Way too easy :)
Listen to the interlude above this poll-tweet. Lovely, lovely song :) https://t.co/38Zyf8qcDj
5/5 on-the-job learning is the most interesting part. 

And yes, the comments below 'Chinna Pura Ondru' (https://t.co/Mz8MaCFrpx - Anbe Sangeetha, 1979. Music: Ilayaraja) that go, "After Vijay Antony interview' is an excellent feedback for the interview itself :)
4/5 knowledge-gathering (he embodies this trait so beautifully), by constantly being curious about the things around and him... all are hugely interesting and inspiring. And that he straddles between 2 departments (music and film-making/acting), and both through sheer
3/5 name of acting, or the lack of it.

This interview explains that perspective well since even he is aware of this. His sharp awareness of his limitations, the way he converts those limitations as his strength by sheer effort and grit, his strength in
2/5 because of its edgy story and the fact that someone even dared to accept such a role. But, to be absolutely honest, I haven't liked any of his subsequent films. I also honestly think his acting range is incredibly limited and that he sometimes gets away with a lot, in the
Surprisingly illuminating interview with Vijay Antony, by @baradwajrangan  https://t.co/fYqHh551pB 

'Surprisingly' because I least expected this man to be this interesting, self-aware, humble and completely cool! I really liked his debut film as an actor (Naan) mainly 1/5
5/5 Went on a mild nostalgic trip... this 2014 interview with Viji, in The Hindu! https://t.co/LU8YIotMGA

Viji passed away in August 2015. https://t.co/u0dEFtjRO6 https://t.co/AirxgLos1J
4/5 looking for was Kaadhal Jodithaan. https://t.co/H8roGFUrUk

I had not registered the composer's name back when I first heard and loved the song - now, I figured it was celebrated keyboard player Viji Manuel!
3/5 Starting with Sarath Kumar's filmography, I first thought it was Chithirai Pookkal (1991). After listening to that film's songs, found that it was not the film I was looking for. 

Then, I stumbled on Idhaya Vaasal (1991, again!)... and that was the film! The song I was
2/5 sitting in the back seat. This is usually Vijaykanth territory, with him playing the savior of the film's young lead pair - like he has done in films like Poonthotta Kaavalkaaran and Senthoora Poove (both in 1988!).
Recalled a 90s song by tune (had forgotten the lyrics) completely by chance and was desperately trying to figure out the song and film. I recalled only one thing in terms of scene - Sarath Kumar driving a jeep in a hilly region. And perhaps he had a (possibly lead) pair 1/5
