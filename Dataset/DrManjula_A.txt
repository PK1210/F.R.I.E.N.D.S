“Handlooms are my life, my identity. Each weave is like a palette of colours that brings out the artist in me with the colours, beliefs and dreams. They elevate my mood, bring whole life alive and keep me grounded."

Come let's Celebrate #NationalHandloomDay on 7th August 2019. https://t.co/crsvyUasGh

Can we inspire the generation next ?? 
With today’s scenarios- can they be inspired to be Doctors??
I believe there is still hope. 

Happy Doctors day!

Time to rethink- Doctors are dying in the hands of the very people they are trying to protect.

One more reason for the next generation for not vying for this profession.

Time to rethink policies and safety .

Knock knock!!

My Solo trip- 2/6/2019
My last day here- hornbillcamp 

Into the forest- to see elephants- the magnificent ones.

On a tree-wildlife, sounds of forest- enjoying the nature.

There is peace inspite of noise because I’m not affected by noise!

@HulkatMulga nothing supports violence
@sb1591 absolutely- that is what we all want
@sb1591 no problem Satyam - we are used to people who don't trust doctors
@samee102 more money and less intolerance is there in other professions. People will start choosing those professions in the future
@sb1591 cause &amp; effect is never proved here . Killing a doctor, hitting hard that vision is lost, brain surgery is needed - is unacceptable
@sanket9329 but does not excuse violence
@sanket9329 i am sorry if it happened
@sb1591 i am sorry if u had bad experiences
@sb1591 I know- but unfortunately- same situation from past 25 years - knee jerk reaction on the soft targets - last straw was the judgment
@sb1591 dear Mr. Satyam - when demonetisation happened- people suffered but change prevailed- emergencies are taken care of.
@sanket9329 people can choose the doctor whom they want to visit -
@sonu_juyal we want people to treat doctors like humans - not GODS
@sb1591 agreed - we are against attacks - not against anything else. It us by choice - next gen will not choise of this will continue
@yogesh2702 @Guttajwala probably- strike would not have happened if patients treat doctors like humans - emergency services prevail
@sb1591 they get paid for the job- not for attacks
@sb1591 agreed- so - treat doctors like humans - like others
@sonu_juyal @Guttajwala to survive the attacks on them
If doctors are BAD - let them go on strike - why stop them https://t.co/R5FED4uQUk
When will people understand that Doctors are putting their youth, sleep , sanity and life at stake just working for others
In active participation at - round table on women Employability - hoping to make a difference
