I have used both #fillers and little bit of #Botox to get this amazing result for the patient. This definitely was one of the toughest cases that I worked on. (3/3) #BoTalks #LipFillers #LipEnhancement
Here is one such before &amp; after case where you can clearly see the inward rolling lip in the before image when the patient smiles. After enhancement, it is evident that there is an increase in lip volume &amp; the inward rolling isn't there anymore. #LipFillers #Botox #BoTalks (2/3) https://t.co/fIsK2wfleg

I have spoken about the benefits of laser in my previous videos. In the next, I will be talking about one of the most neglected parts of the body i.e. the neck and the importance of using facial treatment for it. Stay tuned! (2/2) #FacialsAtRa
The answer is YES. #Laser helps the skin in many ways. From removing pigmentation, stimulating the collagen, tightening open pores to making the skin even toned; Skin Laser does it all. 
#FacialsAtRa (1/2) https://t.co/UGQEs5AqD5
Step 3. This is a much more superficial #laser after the soft light laser. This takes away the pigmentation from the top layer of the skin and makes it even toned.

No, results of #Botox are not instant. It takes about 24-48 hours to kick in and reaches its maximum effect in around a week and lasts for several months. #BoTalks https://t.co/rzk2MsQyz9
The more skilled the injector, the more things she/he can do with botox. It can be used to lift eyebrows, lift the corner of the mouth, enhance the jawline, extend the chin and even treat migraine! #BoTalks https://t.co/3llA4glwOL
Thought so? The answer is No. #Botox doesn't freeze the face but makes it look fresh and youthful. It is very important to get it done from an experienced injector. #BoTalks https://t.co/XV7V4swAMl

What's your worst nightmare when it comes to lips? #LipCare #DrRashmiShetty #RaSkin
For example: a filler to correct a line on your face might last lesser to a filler injected deep into the tissue. For more, do watch this video: 
https://t.co/fLDIJiZ0AA. #Fillers #dermatology
Most frequently asked question to me this past week has been," Are fillers permanent?". The answer to which is - #Fillers used TODAY are not permanent. A filler lasts for anywhere between 6 months to 2 years depending on the material used and also the end objective. (1/2) https://t.co/X0OsV7h0jz

#LipEnhancement with injections is the most sought after procedure these days. It can get tricky as some lips are too thin, some curl up when they smile, some are disproportionate. The key is to make it look beautiful each time &amp; making sure it looks as natural as possible.

@Ajitshah73 Consult an expert first before using any or read the ingredients if you have the knowledge yourself.
@Ajitshah73 Face masks are good in general be it Indian, Korean, etc. should be specifically used for specific reasons. Also, beware that as harmless as any face mask may look they can cause skin irritation and rashes.
Get the timeless look with the facial that is best-suited for your skin type and age. RA Pollogen facial is one that works for all ages like magic as it:
