@woahitsjuanito A B b-movie is an oasis this year.
She‚Äôs hardly ever damseled, she‚Äôs self-sufficient, and even when her arc is at her most stock, every narrative decision is in service to the character. We should get a half dozen of these single space thrillers every year.

@Madmaddingcrowd @Honors_Zombie I never looked, did any outlet interview that young girl from Hereditary?
@Honors_Zombie @Madmaddingcrowd Oof, excuse the typo. That‚Äôs too long to write out again.
@Honors_Zombie @Madmaddingcrowd For sure, but we have to find a way to have To find room for Crawl and something like Hagazussa in the same ecosystem without using one to bludgeon the other.
@Madmaddingcrowd @Honors_Zombie I‚Äôm so curious how i‚Äôll feel about this new one, I need to find a way to extricate that feeling of smugness I get from his direction and find a way more productive, good faith way to articulate it
@Honors_Zombie @Madmaddingcrowd Kind of where I landed on a rewatch but not quite that strong. He can conjure atmosphere but to what end.
@Madmaddingcrowd @Honors_Zombie I‚Äôm starting to feel bad for him though. People turned on this movie in like a week. Or at least slight majority I‚Äôve seen have.
@Honors_Zombie That‚Äôs kind of what I‚Äôve heard? Tone, I‚Äôm assuming?
Should I watch Don‚Äôt Look Now or LaBute‚Äôs Wicker Man before Midsommar? Both would be first watch.
@Brian_Tallerico It tuns out that Edward Yang really knows how to make a movie.
I think Yi Yi slightly edges this one out for me from moment to moment, but there's a singular power to the way this one emotionally accumulates and its meticulous dramatic texture.

Been saving my first viewing of First Blood for today. It‚Äôs all about how great America is, right?
Jet packs are always good, but they‚Äôre even better when they make areas that seem out of bounds part of the path. Only comparison I can think of is Portal 2.

@axchiles Thanks, Alex, I really appreciate that. Truth is something i've been thinking about a lot so I hope that's something I communicate the best I can. I try to be as transparent as possible with my feelings.
I appreciate the honestly of those who responded to this. I know it's an ongoing struggle, but sometimes it feels less isolating to just admit it.
@ctnash91 I knoww, just trying to figure out if anyone has some secret holy grail of a solution haha. Fwiw, it's also because there are about a dozen to two dozen writers who consistently write so adroitly and personally about film that it feels impossible to compete. Not a bad thing tbh.
@LeighMonsonPBF Jeez, Leigh, you can't even let me be unique by being the only one with these feelings...
Write more is probably the answer, but my imposter syndrome has gotten a serious workout lately. Just a continuous feeling that I have nothing to add other than to mirror others' thoughts less elegantly. Anyone have any suggestions for fighting this feeling?

@trillmoregirls Hahahaha, wait until you do the stupid environment cleansing ones. I swear I like this game, just a lot of gristle to get through.
@trillmoregirls Should say, I know this is the major balance issue of so many open world games these days but damn if it doesn't depress me with something like Spider-Man.
@trillmoregirls Oh shit, that is perfect timing then! Imo Spider-Cop received plenty of deserved criticism, but that was the tip of the iceberg for me. I'd be very curious to hear what you think when you finish or get into the strange loop of side activities/apocalyptic main story missions.
@trillmoregirls Not sure if you play games but the Spider-Man PS4 game leans even further in fascinating and deeply disconcerting ways between the gig economy frivolousness of superhero work and the horror of living in a world of superheroes/villains.
@trillmoregirls Nathan, this is sharp as hell and definitely clarified the more reciprocal push/pull of Raimi's film in a way I couldn't put my finger on in comparison to the odd dissonance of brutality and fizzy relationship drama in Homecoming.
@trillmoregirls Thanks! I'll take a look. Wouldn't go so far to say I hated the whole of Homecoming, but it's really difficult to read between the lines of reviews of the new one when they call it a triumph. The always reliable Jake Cole at Slant seems to be the exception.
