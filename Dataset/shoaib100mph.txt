OH MY GOD! 
What a match for a World Cup Final. 
This is as good as a trophy shared. 
Match tied, super over tied, England wins on more boundaries hit. Wow. Great scenes at Lords. 

#ENGvNZ #CWC19
One thing is for sure, we are going to have a new world champion this time. 
Team 1 &amp; 2 defeated in the semi finals, Team 3 &amp; 4 making it to the final. 
England defeated Australia comprehensively.  
It will be a good final to watch.

Devastated to hear about the Sadiqabad train collision.
Its so painful to hear about such incidents. I hope action is taken on people responsible for this and its ensured that it does not happen again. 
Thoughts, prayers and well wishes with the affected families. 

#Sadiqabad
India did not bat well enough to reach the final. A resilient effort by Jadeja &amp; Dhoni. They almost brought India back into the game. 
So a big upset, New Zealand goes through to final, India knocked out. 

#INDvsNZ #CWC19 #semifinal
Rained out games always disturb the balance of the game. Flipping over to the next day can go heavily in India's favor. Hoping for a full game tomorrow.

Will #India reach the Lord's for the #CWC19final or will New Zealand strike back? 
#CWC19 #INDvsNZ @HomeOfCricket https://t.co/jXknFMe04l
Can India cross the barrier? Will it be a walk in the park? 

Or 

Will it be an upset? Can New Zealand give a phainta to India &amp; reach their 2nd World Cup Final? 

Game of nerves today.

Another big total wasted. A lot to think when you cannot defend 358. 
As a captain, @SarfarazA_54 needs to step up and make solid decisions.
Solid 151 by @ImamUlHaq12. 
Tagra 100 maara hai. 

358 is a big score. Upto the bowlers now to defend.

My beautiful city Islamabad. Never fails to surprise me with its breath taking views.

Could have been a historic run chase. Couldn't finish it. Lovely knock by @FakharZamanLive. Captain should have been able to take them across the line. Need more focus &amp; dedication.

Whatever @SAfridiOfficial has written about harsh behavior from seniors, reality was much more than that. He should have said more. 
Actually he should have said it 20 years ago. If he did at the right time, he wouldn't have had to write a book today. https://t.co/ISpK8VqG6t
Deeply saddened to hear about the suicide blast outside the Sufi Shrine of Hazrat Ali Hajveri, Data Darbar. 
Prayers &amp; thoughts with the affected families.
I found this hilarious. Haha

Ibaadat kerain, sabar kerain, eat well, eat healthy. 
Doosro k liye jitna kuch ker saktay hain, zaroor kerain.
Bus sab nay yaad rakhni hai aik baat.
Ramzan is a lot more than pakoray aur samosay. 
Kuch samajh aayi??
Ramzan Mubarak to everyone. 
Allah ka lakh lakh shukar k us nay humain aik aur Ramzan ka maheena ataa kia. 
May Allah bless you all. Be kind to everyone and help others as much as you can. 
Allah sab ko dher sari khushiyan de  :) https://t.co/bQXxHK6odS
Good knocks by @babarazam258 &amp; Haris Sohail. 
Bowling lacked the current today. That gave England the chance to settle in &amp; chase a decent total. 
Keep it together guys.

I understand the pain of all the people who cannot afford to have a car or rent one. I still believe its not worth taking a risk with the lives of your children. Having 5 people on a motorcycle is not something thats safe for you or your children. Allah sab ko amaan main rakhay. https://t.co/t1maXk6yAQ
Good beginning guys. Keep up the hard work. Get acclimatized. https://t.co/U6hLvkvs4f
@KumarSanga2 is one of the finest batsman i have played against. A thorough gentleman. https://t.co/FGYfxEXUXW
On this day,  I was at one of my favorite grounds in the world i.e Gaddafi Stadium Lahore.
Temperature was soaring high, Adrenalin was higher! Haha
What an amazing memory. Something that got me the tag of 'fastest bowler on the planet'.
