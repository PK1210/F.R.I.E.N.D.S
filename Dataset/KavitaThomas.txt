#antanstead maybe the perfect partner! Makes me so happy for Christina! #christinaonthecoast
@TajGeorge just wanted to pop in and tell you! You are a stunner! Also Weak is one of my most favourite songs! Pops in my head once a week atleast! Thank you for the music!
@KimKardashian Kanye’s episode with David letterman was fire and I wondered (no pressure) if you would ever consider talking about how you help him through being bipolar while not losing yourself. You do so well and I think your journey could help a lot of women out there.
@BravoTV @TinsleyMortimer Lol that’s expecting a bit too much from this lot.

Don’t get this show? Is it about finding love?is it about making money?either way my fav is the narrator! 😅😂😅 #ParadiseHotel
@GAUAHAR_KHAN We harass our women to stay true to our cultural dress ,but men donning traditional attire is laughed at. What a confused bunch we are 🙄

You can’t have lived this much life , in high society with money and lack this much self awareness! That’s some embarrassing shiz! #rhony
Why are these women being dressed in negligees for this wedding? #STARonfox
@IAMJustLetitia So Dayam selfish all the time! Don’t get why everyone tries so hard to get her attention or love!
@MawVand @Nada70088471 @SpartanChic93 @Andy @mrjaxtaylor @BNCartwright @stassi @ariana2525 @TomSandoval1 @kristendoute I found her queen bee show. That looks hella scripted!
@Serendiotic Bahaha! Amen ! Marlo and nene got me all kinds of bothered this season. But even marlo shines in moments. Nene just straight selfish and awful. Good time to binge since it’s over (almost)
@MawVand @Nada70088471 @SpartanChic93 @Andy @mrjaxtaylor @BNCartwright @stassi @ariana2525 @TomSandoval1 @kristendoute Holy shit! That’s cray!
@Serendiotic Also I can’t with nene either! It’s been too much this whole season! 😓
@Serendiotic Bahaha oh shit my bad! Yeah billy has been grandstanding a bit much! I love how Lisa calmly sets everyone straight! #boss
@MawVand @Nada70088471 @SpartanChic93 @Andy @mrjaxtaylor @BNCartwright @stassi @ariana2525 @TomSandoval1 @kristendoute Holy shit stassi was in another reality show!! I have to know how real that was and what happened! 🤯
@SpartanChic93 @Andy @mrjaxtaylor @BNCartwright Exactly!!!!
@BRAVOpinions_ @LisaVanderpump @KyleRichards Feel like Lisa May never get over this one! She’s too queen for the way she’s been handled by all these ladies!
@Serendiotic Bahaha who did that! Feels very nene 😂
@Serendiotic But they aren’t her friends lol! It doesn’t make sense. They are her boyfriend’s ex crew. If they’re not friends with him anymore she shouldn’t be hankering for inclusion in his gang.
Oh #Carl how does that table turn feel there bud? So conflicted on this guy. He’s got such great potential to be a catch. But after binge watching season 1&amp;2 ... it’s tough to forget!   #summerhousebravo #SummerHouse
@Serendiotic I feel ya but she’s always going... “James.. its sucks for me, cause they don’t want to hang with me because of you!” Comes across like she’s a bit thirsty to be a part of the pump gang. Who want nothing to do with james or her.
Why does #raquel want to be friends with James ex-friends so badly! Seems like a  desperate ploy to stay relevant on the show. LA is big enough honey! Find your own clique. #PumpRules #VanderpumpRules
Can’t believe how out of touch #billmaher is on women’s issues. Makes me realise you really don’t know it if you haven’t been through it! Thank god For #chelseahandler cause that was a hard watch! 🙄 Sometimes you have to stop watching to your favourites!
@YTWFXX wow! That was a ride! So many emotions and ended so perfectly! Will miss y’all ❤️❤️ #YoureTheWorstFX #YoureTheWorst
@GordonRamsay What the hell! Congrats to you and fam! can’t believe y’all still baby making After 4! ❤️
And how are people so unaware of who Joss Stone is? Where y’all been? She is literally the only mainstream musician featured on the show! #EmpireFox
Don’t even understand where you guys are going with the story! It’s like you thought of an end and are now reaching to manufacture storylines to get there. Everyone acting out of character!🙄.#EmpireFox
@JoyouslyJoyyy Joss Stone been A legend way longer than empire ! She’s amazing!
How did @KristinCav go from the bitch of The Hills to the most positive reality show on tv! Binged #VeryCavallari and in love! ❤️❤️
@lohanbeachclub ugh! watching #brent on this show almost made me stop watching. Both Lindsay and panos props for the beautiful beach club but you guys need to rethink your management style.
@stassi Didn’t dr oz say the exact opposite based on “extensive research” on WWHL?
@EvanSmith22 @IAMKCITY @JavensWorld @JohnTIGuy Your castmates were fine! You on he other hand! We should all pray we dont waste our time with men like you!
@Nicolekayfit You good girl! You deserve to be trusted and happy! Hope you found that!
Teddi Mellencamp has guilty face all through these episodes thus far. Like I’m going down so imma take you with me! Dunno how I feel about MVP LVP but there’s something off about teddi @BravoTV #rhobh #rhob
@shambayah @ElanAllende @JennyAllende21 Really liking this track! Happy for you Guys! Keep doing it on your own! It’s worth so much more! Best of luck! ❤️
@chrissyteigen @BravoTV Let’s do this! Hehe
@JasonH27 But don’t you think the only person still getting love and support is James? Despite his vile attitude and behaviour? Like Lisa can’t seem to stop giving him chances.
@its_arapp Right???
@Squisite1 Phew me too! Something about her ... from episode 1 .
@people Oh come on! Who understands Ramona lol.
@juicytvgoss Is it though? Lol
Why are the guys so into douchey James! I don’t get it. Why is loyalty to your women/bffs such a foreign concept. Also #TomSandoval just bcoz a woman pays doesn’t mean folks should get comfy and complacent. No matter how big the heart. It always gets old. #pumprules
@thevirdas was that you I just saw in whiskey cavalier? Well done!!! Kill it! #indianskillingamericantv
@TeddiMellencamp @lisarinna You dead blind if you couldn’t see the clear pot stirring from Rinna! How easily swayed are you women!
@TeddiMellencamp So?
@kingbravoviewer Real classy
If #LisaVanderpump let’s #JamesKennedy back in I’d be shocked! With or without the alcohol! he can’t help his offensive mouth or shitty personality!#PumpRules #VanderpumpRules
@kebajer Lol do they ever?
@khloekardashian Yeah khloe . You are my absolute fav from the very beginning but you really went the wrong way on this one. I tots understand your feelings But As women we need to hold our men accountable for their mistakes. Regardless of the roles they play in our lives! Glad you came around.
@wintersunnyd Literally her exact face!
@VishalKOfficial @arya_offl @sayyeshaa Cray! Can’t believe you two boys are getting hitched! Much love and the best of luck! X
@miss_brittanyx0 @SHO_Shameless Agreed! Lazy AF plot that makes 0 sense!
Y’all trying too hard to write Fiona out of the show. Slights unbelievable that these characters would show compassion to everyone except the one person who raised them and sacrificed for them. Or maybe y’all are trying to get us worked up #Shameless #fionagallagher
@SundeepBallagan @GordonRamsay @PlaneFood @HeathrowAirport That’s an appalam not roti! Or pappad!
