Some rules in cricket definitely needs a serious look in.
We failed to deliver as a team when it mattered, 30 minutes of poor cricket yesterday &amp; that snatched away our chance for the cup. My heart is heavy as I’m sure yours is too.The support away from home was incredible.Thank you all for painting most of uk blue wherever we played 🇮🇳

Heartbreaking news coming out from New Zealand. What’s happened to humanity?
First time in 22 years @realmadrid has failed to qualify for @ChampionsLeague shows how dominant &amp; consistent they have been in Europe. Any team can have one bad year, it’s no big deal. They are still a powerhouse.
