@virginmedia And since I have never signed any contract this phone call is my only verbal contract with your company.
@virginmedia This is despite the data protection act and the fact that the length of my contract is 18 months.
@virginmedia I've asked for the phone conversation to be listened to. Kind gentleman informed me they probably only kept it for 6 months.
@virginmedia Was also promised callback from senior manager within 48 hours. 4 and a half now left.
@virginmedia The team have advised me that a written contract (which I have never signed) stated different terms to those relayed on phone.
