#OnceUponATimeInHollywood is dazzling but overlong &amp; scattered. My cinema high came from Bong Joon-ho's #Parasite, which is darkly comic, brilliant &amp; eventually devastating. The best way to say goodbye to #Cannes2019 For me, it's a wrap!

Is it cool to cry in Cannes? Over the past week, I've found myself teary-eyed in too many films - Pain and Glory, The Climb, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Diego Maradona, Frankie.  Films about art, frailty, family, mortality, relationships.  It's been a good week! @Festival_Cannes
"A little bit of cheating and a lot of genius." In #DiegoMaradona @asifkapadia creates a gripping and heartbreaking portrait of a man who briefly became God. It doesn't matter if you like football (I have no interest). This film is so much more! @Festival_Cannes
Achyutanand Dwivedi won a #Nespressotalent2019 award @Festival_Cannes for his short Seed Mother. You can watch the film on @filmcompanion here: https://t.co/izsFBmcuPW https://t.co/HUaEU9Uvvg

#Rocketman is shiny, gaudy, delirious and satisfying.  @TaronEgerton keeps the film airborne even when the narrative gets lost in spectacle.  It's drama, emotion, sentiment, song - in short, Bollywood on a bigger budget!
#Leila looks so good: https://t.co/NdXCy6RPBE

I found The Dead Don't Die underwhelming (though Tilda Swinton is, as always, formidably striking) but enjoyed Deerskin, the opening film at Directors' Fortnight.  It's a funny &amp; macabre look at obsession, loneliness &amp; making movies! #Cannes2019
Scoring a good seat is the ultimate win @Festival_Cannes -    After cold, rain and a 40-minute wait, I feel the joy of a world-class athlete üòÇ #Deerskin #Cannes2019

Sobering thought as @Festival_Cannes kicks off - 1845 films were submitted to the 2019 official selection. No Indian film made it. And it's been 25 years since an Indian film got into the main competition - the last one was Swaham in 1994. What's wrong? #genuinequestion

My recommendation this weekend is the Oscar-winning #FreeSolo - a documentary that will redefine what you think a human being and cinema can do. The film is both, a fascinating character study &amp; terrific inspiration. Do watch - in theatres today!
