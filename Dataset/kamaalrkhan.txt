Film #Bharat is also a commercially hit because it has done ‚Çπ185Cr lifetime business. But it‚Äôs also a flop coz @BeingSalmanKhan is the biggest super star in the Bollywood, So his film should not do less than 300Cr lifetime business.
Today @iHrithik is such a big super star that his film can‚Äôt get less that ‚Çπ30Cr opening and lifetime business min 200Cr, if he chooses right films.
Commercially #Super30 is also a hit. Theatrical share will be approx 50Cr+ 80Cr from other rights. Total 130Cr! Landing cost is 125Cr!
But it‚Äôs a flop as per big stardom of @iHrithik! His film should not do less than ‚Çπ200Cr lifetime business!
Commercially #Article15 is a hit. Landing cost is 25Cr! @ayushmannk charged only ‚Çπ3.5Cr! Theatrical share will be approx 25Cr! And producers will get approx 20Cr profit from all other rights. So congratulations to @anubhavsinha and team.

Film #Super30 got huge growth of approx 100% on 2nd Saturday and it‚Äôs all because of words of mouth of public instead of critics.

These are 3 reasons, why #SattePeSattaRemake will be a sure shot disaster!
1) Farah Khan is really a very very very bad director.
2) Story of Satte Pe Satta can‚Äôt work in today‚Äôs time.
3) No other actor can do as good comedy as Amit Ji.
#Hrithik n #KatrinaKaif are doing #FarahKhan‚Äôs #SattePeSattaRemake n it will be a disaster if even GOD himself becomes audience. I watched #SattePeSatta n it‚Äôs one of the most Wahiyat films I have watched. So I don‚Äôt know, how it was a hit? May be coz of huge stardom of Amit Ji.
2 films are releasing on coming Friday and I will review only one. So which one I should review?
Last survey- Will you watch film #ArjunPatiala in the theatre? Vote no if you will watch on TV or net.
Last survey- Will you watch film #JudgementallHaiKya in the theatre? Vote no if you will watch on TV or net.

I can say with 100% guarantee that #Trump will give huge amount to help Pakistan because USA needs Pakistan to fight war with Iran. Right Now #Trump is squeezing Pakistan, Taaki Pakistan Se deal Acchi Mil Sake!üëè
Politics:-America asked Saddam to attack Iran and they both did fight war for 8years. Then USA encouraged Iraq to attack Kuwait n after getting money from Kuwait, USA forced Iraq forces to leave Kuwait. And then hanged Saddam. Means USA can do any work but supari Milani chahiye!
Election is coming up in the USA, means #Trump has to attack Iran for sure. China and Russia will support Iran. Means world war is 100% confirm. So better do whatever you want to do during next few months. Coz Kaunsa Din Aakhri Hoga, Kaha Nahi Jaa Sakta! All the best friends.üëçüåπ

Now it‚Äôs confirm that #Chichore #SateliteShankar and #Commando3 will be releasing on 6th September and all 3 films will become disasters. Means it‚Äôs also confirm now that TV actor #SushantSingh will be doing TV serials soon.
Producers released this news:- Shraddha Kapoor's film #Chhichore postponed to 6th September 2019, to avoid clash with #Saaho on 30th August 2019! Means producers are calling it a Sharadha Kapoor‚Äôs film. This is the value of TV actor @itsSSR today.ü§™üò≠üòÅüëå
Only 2 types of people become actors.
1) Who is very clever like Amit Ji, SRK, Aamir etc.
2) Totally duffer who doesn‚Äôt know anything at all like Sushant and Arjun.
It's one year already!! Two duffer and talentless actors and one super flop. Even nepotism didn‚Äôt save the film #Dhadak from becoming a super flop. #1YearOfDhadak
Our actors are such a duffers that everyday, they give some crap statements to do their own ‚ÄúMaa Ki Aankh‚Äù! They think that they are actors, So they are clever. But they don‚Äôt know Ki Agar Unmain Akal Hoti Toh Actor Kyon Hote?ü§™üòÅ
Ranbir Kapoor became super star after #YeJawaniHaiDiwani, then he did some crap films to become Zero. Again he became super star after the release of #Sanju. So again he signed some crap films like #SHAMSHERA #Brahmastra n sex film of #LuvRanjan. Means this boy is Akal Se Paidal.
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.
#SaturdayMotivation
#SaturdayThoughts
2nd Madhur Bhandarkar, sex film maker #LuvRanjan has made all his films on one single subject. Even his assistant made film #DeDePyarDe on the same subject. But still Ranbir n Deepika are doing his film. Why? Coz Ranbir‚Äôs #Shamshera is shelved and #Barahmastra can be a disaster.
#Dhoni said that he is not going to retire soon. Matlab Banda Baaki cricketers Ki Tarah Hi, Beizzati Karakar Hi Bahar Niklega, Ye confirm Ho Gaya!
I simply can‚Äôt understand, why #MadhurBhandarkar never mention his first cult classic film #Trishakti name in the list of his films? That film can be used to torture criminals in the police stations today.
It‚Äôs KRK box office review of film #FamilyOfThakurganj! https://t.co/yuTtNlozPU

All the very best to entire team of today releasing film #FamilyOfThakurganj! Hope it will get bumper opening to become a hit.
I am delighted to inform that #Deshdrohi has completed a continuous run of 10 years at the box office. This is a big day for a film which was written off by the critics/trade and nobody expected it to run for more than 10 shows.üòÅ https://t.co/RoideRS4Yu
NEVER MAKE THIS MISTAKE, TO TRY AND BE FAKE, when BEING REAL takes LESS EFFORT!
#FridayThoughts
But good thing is this for @iHrithik that his next release is #War which will do min 200Cr lifetime business and #Krrish3 which will do min 250Cr lifetime business. https://t.co/KVV7qORnV2
Survey result- 34% people don‚Äôt want to know about unknown Anand Kumar and 28% ppl didn‚Äôt like the look of Hrithik in the film. Means 62% huge number Of ppl didn‚Äôt want to watch #Super30! And this is why it can‚Äôt do 200 or 300Cr lifetime business. https://t.co/gFOCSEV15a
Survey result is proof that 40% audiences hate both Sidharth and Parineeti, while few % more ppl hate Parineeti compare to Sid. And This is the biggest hurdle in the way of their up coming films. https://t.co/C2o0vfWLeO
Whatever you want to assume, it‚Äôs ur wish. But my opinion is only mine about everyone, whoever is he like Karan Johar, Hrithik, Salman khan or Kangana Ranaut. Nobody can influence my opinion about anyone or any film.
I like Kangana Ranaut only for one simple reason that she is not afraid of anyone. She takes on All the big stars, producers, directors, media ppl and still having many films. She is against entire Bollywood and still Bollywood can‚Äôt do anything. Unbelievable and unreal.üëèüëèüëèüòÅ
Kangana Ranaut said that she wants to work with Ranveer singh and Vicky Kaushal. But madam Ji, they want to work in the Bollywood. They can‚Äôt afford to sit at home after doing film with you.ü§™
Today, If films of Vicky Kaushal, Ranveer, Varun, Ayushmann, Kartik are doing 100Cr+ business, then big stars like Salman, Aamir, Hrithik films must do min 200Cr+ business to keep them in the category of big super stars.
Ayushmann Khurrana have changed so many words in his name and still his crap film #Article15 didn‚Äôt cross 50Cr mark. Agar Ye Apne Naam Main Itne words change Nahi Karta Toh Kaya #Article15 50Cr Ka business Nahi Karti? 100% Karti! But some people like to get fooled by Fraud Sanjay
Film makers make films for public, so they should think about public choice before to make a film. And if they make crap films for their own happiness like Anurag Kashyap, then they should watch those films at their home to get tortured. Why should public pay and get tortured?
In case you didn‚Äôt watch the film #Super30 so why?
Why #Super30 is a flop?
1) People are not interested to know about unknown Anand Kumar!
2) People are not interested to watch a Bihari back drop film.
3) Today people are not interested to watch Gareeb n colourless film.
4) It looks more Bhojpuri film than Hindi coz of language.
Film #Super30 is almost finished and somehow it might touch 100Cr magic figure. Producers will recover their investment but it‚Äôs not a hit to keep Hrithik in the race of big super stars. Budget is 125Cr means film should do min 200Cr lifetime business. Therefore it‚Äôs a FLOP!
Survey result-65% people think that Hrithik should not do film of mahta flop director Farah khan! Janta Ki Awaz Nakkare Khuda! https://t.co/fGhrH2QIvf
Survey result- 17% people want to watch film #Familyofthakurganj means film can get good opening. All the best to producers! https://t.co/Y4CjhvXShd
Survey result- #Saaho release postponed and #BatlaHouse is getting all the benefits. Ppl are not interested to watch #MissionMangal. But 11% ppl will watch any of the film after my review. https://t.co/KERHnjBBHo
Hahaha! Very true! These journalists always make Raee Ka Pahad! https://t.co/Ik65vJ26wm
In case you don‚Äôt want to watch #JabariyaJodi, So because of what?
Survey result- No film got higher tracking than #War during last 10 years. Means guaranteed, film will open 50Cr+! Congrats to @iHrithik and @iTIGERSHROFF! https://t.co/Xx41VfkM3q

Yes! It‚Äôs true that I love #Hrithik from bottom of my heart so I did release my review of #Super30 on Sunday instead of Thursday means 3 days later. But I did my review with 100% honesty like of any other star film. Even I gave 3-4* to many Akshay kumar n Kangana films also.
If u will see the review of #KomalNahta of #Super30 then it‚Äôs much much better film than #sholay n #MughalEAzam, so of course it should do 1000Cr lifetime business. Why did he say that? Because producers did show him film on Monday before 4days of release with Samosa+ cold drink!

If people believe these #2RsCritics and these fake üåü are having any value then each of the film should do ‚Çπ300Cr lifetime business at DBO. But one will do 50Cr and another will do 100Cr, means business as per stardom. Means not even #2Rs value of these critics n their reviews. https://t.co/h57kJXAxnm
Film #Super30 can‚Äôt collect more than 75Cr in first week and it will face big film #LionKing on 2nd Friday. Means film will face tough time ahead.

My Prediction of the day! Film #Marjaavan will do 3Cr business on day1 if it will release with #WAR! Therefore makers should change the release date immediately. @zmilap @itsBhushanKumar @Riteishd @SidMalhotra @nikkhiladvani @tarasutariaa @Rakulpreet
I predict today that film #WAR will get 50Cr opening! @iHrithik @iTIGERSHROFF! Save this tweet for record.
Hrithik and Tiger film #WAR and #Marjaavaan are releasing on 2nd October. So which film you will watch?
Ek Toh Sidharth Malhotra big flop, Aur Oopar Se Kismat Kharab. #War will clash with #marjaavaan and you can easily imagine that which film people will prefer to watch.
I like #War type colourful big films and I hate Cinema of #AramNagar film makers (Anurag kashyap &amp; Co.) because I am not black hearted person, neither see black dream after taking drugs and alcohol. I like Colors, light, happiness and joyful life. I hate crimes and dark life.
My GOD! How big is this teaser of film #WAR? This is just terrific, mind blowing, khatarnak and Zabardast! Only ‚Å¶@iHrithik‚Å© and ‚Å¶@iTIGERSHROFF‚Å© can do this. https://t.co/tikQlFcBtA

My suggestion to @BCCI is this that #Viratkohli should remain captain of test team and #RohitSharma should become captain for one day cricket team. Pls RT if you do agree with me and like for disagree.
#OrmaxMedia business prediction is 95% wrong and 5% #TUKKA is correct. They were wrong for #KabirSingh #Malaal #Article15 and today they are wrong for #Super30 also! And #TheBrandKRK day1 business predictions are 100% right for all those films.
This was my business prediction of #Super30 and it‚Äôs 100% correct, as film collected 11Cr+ on day1 and #Ormax is wrong again like always. Film got 32% opening on day1. https://t.co/fbn6DEnGZv
And dear producers, pls tell me, what do you expect from Komal Nahata except praise, when you show him ur film before everyone else and make him feel that 130Cr ppl watch a film upon his recommendation only. Then the Poor guy has to praise only. https://t.co/kjo6itJzBO
If you show ur film to #2RsCritic Komal Nahata (who‚Äôs family also doesn‚Äôt consider him a critic) before 5days from the release date n consider your film a master piece because of his praise, then you are just an idiot and fooling yourself. Because it has nothing to do with truth.
Last time Director Nikhil Advani made #DDay and producer Rangachari became bankrupt and closed his company #DarFilms. Even Distributor #Wave did lose 6Cr! While Wave got rights of #SahebBiwiGangster to recover the loss of flop film #Special26!
Thanks bro @BvsRavi @iamanandkr!üôè
All the very best to #SajidNadiadwala @Shibasishsarkar #MadhuMantena and @iHrithik for the release of their film #Super30! Hope it will become a Super Hit.
The great #Kohli Ka Yogdaan in last 3 big matches!
#WorldCup2015- 1 run!
#ChampionsTrophy 2017- 5 runs!
#WorldCup2019- 1 run!
Then how is he big player?
He is only big player in fixed normal matches. He should resign and RohitSharma should be the captain!!
This is what I predicted and it‚Äôs 100% correct now! This is the #Jalwa of #KRK! https://t.co/Cm0Ei3fFZR

Australians are getting injured but still fighting for each and every run. This is the JAZBA to play for their country and #Kohli &amp; Co. should learn from them. #ENGvsAUS
I am supporting England today! #ENGvAUS!
#ICCWorldCup2019
Shahid kapoor gave 20 flops in a row but producers didn‚Äôt stop giving him films. #KabirSingh is a hit and he increased his price to 35Cr! Yes! this is the price he asked from a producer, who has lost approx 50Cr on his films in the past.
Jab Ek Baar Ameeri Ki Aadat Padd Jaati Hai, Toh Fir Gareebi Main Jeena Bahut Mushkil Hai!

Survey result- 70% people think that #JabariyaJodi will become a disaster. Means Gayee Bhains Paani Main! https://t.co/iLcIKOFAeI
I have decided to release review of #Super30 on Friday evening instead of Thursday evening!
India cricket team is brilliant but only in India, or on papers or in the field of advertisements.
So #Kohli said in the press conference that people should appreciate team for winning and loss both.
Bhai Aap Zara Ye Batado Ki Aap Jeete Kab Thai? You can‚Äôt even win #IPL. So you should say that you will always lose and ppl should still call you best player. Lol! #AaaThoo!
Actually The biggest problem of Indian team was that The players were considering #NewZealand team just nothing and they were believing to win the match like a Halwa. They didn‚Äôt know that New Zealand bowlers will make them cray for runs.
#NZLvIND #ICCWC2019
What a crap trailer of #BatlaHouse! It will be a sure shot disaster! I have 2 words for this trailer #AaaThooo!! https://t.co/6JAYBguelb
Exit of India from #WorldCup is proof that my prediction can be little bit here and there but can never be 100% wrong. This is the #Jalwa of the no.1 critic #TheBrandKRK!
My prediction is for next 2 matches of #ICCWC2019!
1) England will defeat Australia in semi final.
2) England will defeat New Zealand in final to win #ICCWorldCup2019
Dear #Kohli even though you are a worst captain in the history of Indian cricket but still you will get many advertisements to earn crores of rupees and play with emotions of Public. If you do have little shame then resign from captaincy today only. #IndvsNz
#ICCWorldCup2019
Bro @msdhoni you have proved today that you are best in business. But pls announce retirement from one day cricket today!
It‚Äôs 100% over now. Bye bye #TeamBCCI! But Salute to #Jadeja and #Dhoni!
#ICCCricketWorldCup2019
What a terrific match! It‚Äôs a real semi final now. And salute to Dhoni and Jadeja to make it happen!üëè
#ICCWC2019
Today, Dhoni is proving again that he is the real captain of #BCCITeam!
#ICCWorldCup
If #Kohli is having even little dignity then he will resign from the captaincy today only. But then how will he get so many advertisements to earn crores of rupees?
#INDvNZL
Congratulations to team #NewZealand for defeating #BCCITeam of #Drama Player #Kohli and qualify for the final. And all the best to #BCCITeam for next World Cup, which also it won‚Äôt win.
#ICCCricketWorldCup2019
Bhojpuri films are not bad at all because they are 2 hours long #TikTok videos!
I stopped watching news channels and reading news papers few months ago and I really have got lots of peace in life now. What‚Äôs happening in the country, I really don‚Äôt care anymore!
#KangnaRanaut‚Äôs last 8 super flop films are!
1) Rajjo
2) Rangoon
3) Simran
4) I love NY
5) Katti-Batti
6) Ungli
7) Revolver Rani
8) Manikarnika- Good film but flop coz of big budget.
And 9th super Flop will be #judgementalhaikyaüò≠ü§™
#SidharthMalhotra‚Äôs last 4 super flop films!
1) Ittefaq
2) Bar Bar Dekho
3) A Gentleman
4) Aiyaari
And 5th flop will be #JabariyaJodi!üëèü§™üòÅ
Survey result- 72% people think that film #JudgementallHaiKya will be a super flop. Means nobody can save it at the box office. Because Janta Ki Awaz, Nakkare Khuda! https://t.co/q4xaSA2PXu
Congratulations bro @CastingChhabra for brilliant casting of #Super30! Tera Dunka Shahar Main Baj Chuka Hai!
Reports are out and #Super30 is a brilliant film which will be a sure shot super hit. It can do 200Cr business in India. Congrats to @iHrithik and #MadhuMantena in advance!
Many things changed during last 5 years but one thing is 100% intact that I block min 100 idiot abusers everyday!!
Asin was hit till I was calling her best. Parineeti was hit till I was calling her best. Once I stopped calling them best, they became super duper se Oopar flop. This is the #Jalwa of #TheBrandKRK!
Film #ekvillain was super hit because of Me Me Me #thebrandkrk #ritesh #sharadha and director #Mohit not because of super flop #Sidharth! And that‚Äôs the reason that after #EkVillain, all his films are disasters and few more up coming will become disasters.
You all know that #Parineeti and #Sidharth both are biggest flop actors in the Bollywood today. So will you waste your time and money to watch film #JabariyaJodi?
I don‚Äôt have any problem with this poster but I just want to know that how can Kangana hold more heavy guns than her own weight? https://t.co/odrWewBFcD
Each word of this interview is a gold and 100% truth. ‚Å¶@iHrithik‚Å© is very honest gentleman and he deserves the best in his life. ‚Å¶ https://t.co/oaqJiSPCAh
Don‚Äôt get scared of abusers on @Twitter, Because each and every abuser account is having 0-10 followers only. Means his neighbours also don‚Äôt recognise him. So let him bark and get tired of himself.
Travelling to #Dubai to watch #Super30 first day first show! https://t.co/OLEfb5UM44
Media says that #Andhadhun did business of 400Cr to 500Cr in China coz these Bhookhe journalists can write anything for only 2‚Çπ! Truth is this that #Viacom got only ‚Çπ10Cr share from China. Now producers believe media reports, so they are going to file court case against Viacom.
Shahid kapoor asked ‚Çπ20Cr for a film. He said that he is a bigger star than John, So if John does charge 20Cr then why he should not charge. And I do 100% agree with him.
Producers haven‚Äôt got a single rupee from the profit of so called blockbuster film #Andhadhun! According to Viacom, their investment is 35Cr and they have recovered only 35Cr till date including China share. This is the real business of our films.
Pls note, prediction and reality are 2 different things. I predicted 200Cr business of #DEDEPyarDe but it did only 85Cr lifetime and became flop because it was a bad film. While #KabirSingh has destroyed all the predictions of all the trade Pandits. #Super30 might do better also.
Day1 business prediction of film #Super30 by 3 top trade analysts!
#KRKBoxOffice 10-12Cr!
#SuperCinema   11-12Cr!
#OrmaxMedia     14-15Cr!
Pls note 90% prediction of #Ormax goes wrong. But one thing is clear dat it can‚Äôt open more than 15Cr which is not good for Hrithik‚Äôs stardom
Survey result- 54% people want to watch #Super30 means film can open 30% and day1 business can be 10-12Cr! Weekend 40Cr and lifetime 70-80Cr! https://t.co/rTpDqzx7iM
My this prediction is 100% correct! This is the JALWA of the no.1 critic KRK! https://t.co/pD8vb6luL4
This is what I said few days ago and accordingly #India has won the match #INDvSL! https://t.co/pD8vb6luL4
This Survey result is proof that film #Saaho will destroy #BatlaHouse and #MissionMangal badly. Saaho will open 20Cr+! https://t.co/XdpU9TX1Jn
I watched the song of Film #DreamGirl and I say with 100% guarantee that this film will be a sure shot blockbuster. @ayushmannk is at his best. No other actor can do this role so perfectly except him. Congrats to @writerraj and @ayushmannk for the blockbuster in advance.
Even though if #Super30 does 75Cr lifetime business so it‚Äôs safe. But film has to do 175-200Cr business to keep Hrithik in the race of big super stars like Salman and Ranbir.
Hahaha! Thanks bro @_SanjayGupta!‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/AOkSQ71RZ0
I love Kangana Ranaut for this courage only that she has announced the release of #Dhaakad on #Diwali without any fear of that who else will release his film on the same day. She is all alone standing against entire Bollywood. Saluteüëè
Review of film #HumeTumsePyaarKitna by Gehana Vasishth https://t.co/KEKLQ9AkPl
Film #Malaal is the biggest opener from all today released films.
I will review #Saaho and #BatlaHouse but I don‚Äôt have enough courage to watch film #MissionMangal! So whoever wants to watch it, he can watch at his own risk.
Three films are releasing on 15th August 2019, So which one you will watch in the theatre?
Bhushan kumar is only the presenter of #Saaho and #BatlaHouse, therefore he can‚Äôt avoid the clash of both films. Nikhil Advani producer of #BatlaHouse and south producers of #Saaho are adamant to release their films on 15th August 2019 only. And I am totally loving this clash.
