Me: “Ok.. then I've got the shot!!” https://t.co/2Adr2mJuwj
Let me see if anyone from this ridiculous airline reaches out to me &amp; compensate for my time &amp; irritation. @flyspicejet I am appalled at your sevice..... How come all other aircrafts &amp; airlines  at Mumbai are easily operating &amp; only your airline has a problem with the weather ??
@flyspicejet is  the worst airline I’ve flown! Have been on the mumbai tarmac for 3 &amp; half hours. First they said bad weather... then refuelling!! Seeing other planes take off easily under the same circumstances!! The Captain is absolutely clueless &amp; cannot communicate at all!!
