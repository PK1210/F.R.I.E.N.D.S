Anyway, still curious about what he’s got next but feeling very “calm down, dude.”
I don’t mind his films’ determinism per se, but I do mind how much is meant solely to get us from point A to point B, or that he conceives a clear thesis and memorably horrific set-pieces that actively undermine each other but goes ahead anyway.
MIDSOMMAR: Once again I find myself A) admiring Aster’s ability to create a mood that’s at once nerve-fraying and darkly comic, and B) feeling more irritated by the particulars by the minute.
Did any actor have a better name than Rip Torn? The answer is no.
I would take literal pond scum over McConnell but my gut instinct is that McGrath is a) probably terrible, and b) going to lose with this dumb strategy.

Though Robert Shaw still scares me. He died too young.
As for PELHAM: still a goddamn blast throughout, a thriller where everyone acts more inconvenienced by the bullshit they have to deal with thanks to the hijacking than terrified.
To say nothing of how lively and fun and human she is throughout. Sutherland’s terrific, too, and they play off of each other beautifully, but I don’t know how you walk out of this without thinking she’s one of the best there ever was.
Really appreciated how Fonda plays the climatic scene this time. She tries so hard for so long to subtly pull him away from what he wants to do before finally breaking down, and at that point she *completely* shuts down all function outside of fear. All-timer performance.
Great pairing. KLUTE has such great nervy energy - the sound design, the giallo-esque score, the shadowy photography - and watching PELHAM afterwards builds on that while lightening the mood a bit (read: a lot).
My memory serves me well, right KLUTE does indeed slap.

@filipefurtado @Brian_Tallerico When I was a reporter in South Dakota there was a press release saying he was scouting locations and we planned to follow it but it never developed into anything more.

Mom and dad haven’t seen it all the way through in 20 years. Sis hasn’t seen it at all.
JAWS on 35mm with the family.
@cinematrans It might be! Though I also really love him in SILENCE. I think my earlier phrasing of what I said above was "He's most in his element when he's out of his element."
@marshlands *incredibly obnoxious voice* That's what this film is abo-*me blowing a raspberry*
@marshlands Similarly, I don't like the criticism that a director seems like he's seen one too many movies, but: go outside, man.
However: Andrew Garfield is superb in this. He's always at his best when he's playing someone who's forced a little off-balance and that's the whole game here, so.
UNDER THE SILVER LAKE: I'm not feeling this guy. He's got talent and the secondhand nature of this film is very much *the point* but, as with IT FOLLOWS, it still feels manufactured and self-flattering in a way that I find largely off-putting.

@faceyouhate Throw in Carpenter and those are probably my three answers. Wasn’t aware Cronenberg wasn’t planning anything else but I’m not surprised (also his wife died recently and I did wonder whether that was a factor in the long gap after MAPS).
@Aaron_Hammond88 Watched NASHVILLE earlier this week and I'm seeing JAWS on 35 later today (BLOW OUT I watched on the 4th a couple years ago, seems like the most appropriate  movie for the day).
@Snydel I believe so. I know Kirk Douglas was going to play Crenna's part but disagreed with the direction it was going (Rambo dies in the novel, which was filmed but not ultimately used and I think it might have been softened before that in the scripting stage).
@Snydel It is wild how far that series strays from the tone of the first.

@ChrisVanHorn3 Lyne has such a vivid aesthetic that I wish I liked more of his films. Think JACOB’S LADDER is pretty terrific and FATAL ATTRACTION is good until it betrays its original ending, but that’s about it.
@Honors_Zombie I just love the story in DE PALMA where he talks up ACT OF VENGEANCE (which sounds awesome) and then gets to Simpson/Bruckheimer pitching him this instead.
@Honors_Zombie He did THE DEAD ZONE instead so I think it turned out all right in the end.
Later, both De Palma and John Carpenter turned down another Lyne film, FATAL ATTRACTION. Dude just kept getting De Palma's discards, which is appropriate.
Evidently David Cronenberg was also offered this and that's far more puzzling still.
Watching FLASHDANCE for some reason and I cannot think of this movie without thinking of a bemused Brian De Palma telling the story of being offered to direct it.
@mkowzun https://t.co/MdxdJ0g9Tg
Feel like trying to find something new to say about it is almost futile but I love how Lee makes the conclusion seem inevitable in retrospect without denying characters their regular routines, annoyances and fun. It’s an ordinary day (even with the blowups) until it isn’t.
Needless to say it looks fantastic on film. The colors pop, the shadows are richer, and tiny character details are clearer. See: how tossed off Sal’s threat to smack Vito and Pino is - he’s talking with his mouth full of food, irritated but not yet at what he’d consider “yelling”
I feel like every time I see this I have a new favorite performance in it. Tonight it’s Ossie Davis. Always loved his work here but he plays with a crowd. His asides and bows had the whole theater dying. That “soliloquy” still breaks the heart.

@faceyouhate I am trying to figure out whether or not this is real but I've read enough about what for sure *does* happen in the film for it to seem plausible.

De Palma recognizes how people are used as pawns by unfathomably powerful systems and how images of violence are as brutalizing as the acts themselves. While I wish the film were able to further elaborate, enough gets through.
DOMINO: budget does limit it somewhat, and it feels unfinished and rushed...but at the same time, its fury and bone-deep sadness are palpable, and the motherfucker can still construct a scene like no other.
@j_christley Can’t quite get on board with that but I did like it!
