@shivering__gold @MatWhitecross Don't *think* there any spoilers. It's really an interview about how the film came about and Mat's relationship with the band. A

ok.. gotta go.. thanks so much for all the questions and kind words.  You guys are amazing.  See you back online soon. Bye Mum 😘 PH
I don't know... The Godfather is pretty good too. PH https://t.co/V9y3B03sZo
Mainly @MatWhitecross .. the film is all his vision #legend PH https://t.co/HFSAbI89fD
2/2 @debswild @_FiercePanda @jowhiley @estwilki Ken Nelson, Markus Dravs, Caroline Elleray, Dan Keeling .. + loads more, all ESSENTIAL to the band's story and success, but we just didn't have time to show everything that happened. Film is more impressionistic than historical PH https://t.co/9qXvskuIiN
1/2 We had to leave out so many CRUCIAL people and events.  Quite rightly, @MatWhitecross didn't want to make a straight-up history of the band, it's much more a story of 6 friends than an A to Z of 1998 - 2017.  Literally dozens of people that I wish we'd had time to salute... https://t.co/9qXvskuIiN

I used to be much skinnier.  The band are all much handsomer now. PH https://t.co/IGRd965NZw
@okdemian You should definitely stay for the end credits.  My favourite scene of whole movie is at the very end. PH
Love. PH https://t.co/4CszCBX6DM
hi Mum.  I'm sad to say you're not 😬 will you still watch it ? 😳 https://t.co/KxsDxWSmE9
i'm hoping to sit down and watch it with him on Christmas Eve, 2058. PH https://t.co/8wPGQwbld3
Different smells for different eras: crusty socks and burnt toast for 1997-2000, cigarette smoke and ginsters pasties for 2001- 2003, not sure after that until 2014 - present day, Chris' special rubbing oil for his throat, my haircare products PH https://t.co/0PAvtjwKpj
8 days until A Head Full Of Dreams documentary hits theatres worldwide (then  #PrimeVideo on Nov 16).  Any more questions about the film?  Just making myself another cup of tea... PH #AHFODfilm
Dingwalls RULES! PS Debs' book is really awesome.  I don't know where she dug up all the old flyers, business cards, handwritten letters but it's like a time capsule! PH https://t.co/CRzJRELQRU
