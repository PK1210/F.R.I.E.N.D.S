@SelinaDavis73 @Twitter I deleted it because it ended up stirring up a lot of discussion about an ancillary and distracting side topic that I didn't want to get further into.
@erinbiba Thanks for not making this an attack but making your opinions and concerns be known.
@originalspin For sure -- heightened vigilance definitely warranted in your case. And perhaps raising my baseline for certain categories of statement might also be advisable.
@erinbiba No he definitely sees nothing wrong and has not been careful about staying appropriate since making that statement saying he would.
@originalspin I'm deleting in part because I don't want to put some anonymous and I think largely blameless old man in the crosshairs. At the same time, it is something to consider on my part.
@erinbiba I think vigilance about this stuff just changed a lot between Biden's time and a time of heightened vigilance about this stuff. Biden is totally inappropriate by the new standards, and yet he remains the front-runner because older people simply lack that consciousness entirely.

@tweetsbenedict Yes a certain woke Hollywood online activism definitely had a role in showing that diversity was good business
@tweetsbenedict I think most white people would prefer hyphenated identities to go away. Doesn’t mean they are all blameless, far from it, but the proliferation of hyphenated identities is fed by a deliberate political project run by ethnic elites
@tweetsbenedict Indian Americans got themselves reclassified as Asian Americans in 1982
@tweetsbenedict No there’s a whole professional infrastructure invested in sustaining hyphenated identities
@tweetsbenedict That’s fine, the essay definitely includes elements conducive to ID politics but it’s not where I personally intended to take it though others have and will
@tweetsbenedict Yes but I don’t see the remedy being in id politics, especially for Asians
@tweetsbenedict I think identity politics is largely driven by identity politicians. I never liked it, including in those old essays.
They perceive their hyphenated identities being imposed on them by white Americans -- but to the extent that white Americans persist in these usages, it's almost certainly in deference to the identity politics framework.
@RealPCDonaldT They perceive it that way, but in my view to the extent that white Americans persist in such usages it's largely in deference to identity politicians.
@csilverandgold Well they won't ever experience slavery or segregation. They will experience what remains though layered atop the baseline struggle for inclusion with being from another culture -- those things will mingle.
@csilverandgold This ever greater polarization is making ever more extreme outcomes possible.
@csilverandgold Moreover, while Wright is a strain that has always been around, Obama's expedience required him to abjure him (even as he sought to contextualize it), while Omar's expedience, in the face of Trump, is to double down.
@csilverandgold I'm sympathetic to a core claim of the ADOS movement: that America's unfinished business is with those whom they brought here against their will, not to those who came here voluntarily.
@csilverandgold maybe. it's a bad sign when immigrants assimilate into that, though. immigrants come here for a better life (and broadly tend to achieve it.)
This convergence of reflexively anti-American thinking with marginalized identities is a very bad omen, though. That her political expedience precisely entails these displays is what is worrying.
I see the origins of the baseline hostility to America that pervades Omar's rhetoric in the anti-imperialist and anti-racist academic leftism she's embraced, and not in the popular mood of her community. I hope it's not. https://t.co/Wv6JVjxjql
Some degree of the things that the Post piece describes -- alienation from the wider society, enthusiasm for insurgent global political movements (ISIS in this case), is par for the course in immigrant communities. 

Politicians can either seek to exacerbate or ameliorate.
@hoodontix @romanticwrites To the extent that the existing Democratic party is the center to which you refer, you can definitely say it had a role in the destruction of the working class, you cannot say they demonize minorities.
@romanticwrites @hoodontix Her framing of America is laser focused on the injustices entirely apart from anything that has happened to her subsequently. Is she being criticized by Pelosi because of who she is or because of her attention-seeking conduct?
So who in the end is ultimately responsible for the continuing salience of hyphenated identities? My own personal sense is that the larger share of the responsibility rests with the political coalition fixated on maintaining those identities for its own profit.
They also harden into place in part because we allocate preferential treatment on the basis of those hyphenated identities -- making millions of newcomers eligible for it the instant they set foot on American soil.
@hoodontix @romanticwrites Injustice exists everywhere and is always relative. The injustice she fled was orders of magnitude worse than what she confronts here -- a place of enormous abundance and openness so that even the ostensible victim of American racism gets to win a seat in the national legislature
@romanticwrites @hoodontix Criminal justice can definitely be bad! The stated intention of the story was to show America had failed in its promise (to be a haven for refugees from the poorest country on earth?) and was in fact a place of racism and injustice
Hyphenated identities emerge in part because people don't feel included. They can then be articulated as a collective seeking of inclusion within the whole, or be used to harden, reify, and politicize separation.
@romanticwrites @hoodontix Repeat offenders may be subject to more strenuous punishment -- that's how the law works
@romanticwrites @hoodontix The policy is not to arrest shoplifters at all! So the policy is responsive to the reality -- the policy is not racist, cruel or unjust.
@BlookUshan They scoff at the idea of an unhyphenated one but claim it's because no one non-white is allowed to become unhyphenated -- they are consigned to hyphenated identity by the majority
Only 15 percent of "Asian Americans" apply the term "Asian American" to themselves.
@Sturgeons_Law Only 15 percent of "Asian Americans" apply the term "Asian American" to describe themselves.
Omar wrote a letter to a judge urging rehabilitation rather than punishment for nine Somali-Americans who traveled to join ISIS. She has since kept her distance from the case so as to deny an "easy opportunity for her enemies to paint he as un-American." https://t.co/NpPswAH6GW
