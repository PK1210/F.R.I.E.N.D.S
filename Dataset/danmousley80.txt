Whether you like him or not, no football fan can fault this lads skill, class and passion. @JackGrealish1 showed exactly what he is all about and to score the winner infront of the away end as a fan of the club was unbelievable. #superjack #avfc https://t.co/3TCPXQh4m7
However the way @JackGrealish1 dealt with the situation with class and calmness shows what the kids all about.
What a disgrace. Absolutely disgusting behaviour. Should be arrested and banned for life from going to a football game again. And then the Blues fans give him a heroes send off scum. No one, never mind a footballer should receive that. https://t.co/knMEAksSCn
