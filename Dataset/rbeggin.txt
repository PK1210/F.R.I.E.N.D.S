@geoffhing I got the idea from Oregon! Love to learn from other reporters.
He added that the biggest concern is suboxone, (usually used for treating opioid addition) which has become "the drug of choice" in prisons because it's paper thin and easy to smuggle in. It would be hard to catch while processing lots of used books sent to prisoners, he said.
This is an interesting question. I asked an MDOC spokesman why used books are banned. Here's what he said: https://t.co/NUVraTuKqH https://t.co/QOupQoCciV

Technology advances at a rapid pace. Even if people are in prison for only a few years, they can come out to find a tech landscape wholly different than the one they left, said professor Jennifer Cobbina of MSU. https://t.co/uaMsE1ghzt
MDOC notes these are just a handful of resources for technology training and that inmates learn some of these skills (like learning how to wire a house) in some facilities, but that it's still worth reviewing the policies that can result in these books being banned. https://t.co/S2w74Ce82V
MDOC officials acknowledge this is an odd contrast with their push for vocational skills training and say they plan to review the policies that bar books like these, which are swept up alongside books that would clearly be problems for prisoners to have. https://t.co/1AbZG01MRk
More than 60 books on computers and other technology are banned from Michigan state prisons, designated as threats to the "order and security of the institution." That can be a barrier for inmates seeking skills necessary to function on the outside.

Unrelated to tracking how this money's spent, but also noteworthy: Michigan legislators haven't had a raise since the early 2000s, according to the House Business Office. They actually took a 10% pay cut in 2011.
The Gov. gets $54,000 and the Lt. Gov. gets $18,000 for expenses. I haven't yet heard from the Gov's office as to whether they're required to report how they use it.
BUT they don't have to show how that money is used (receipts, expense reports, travel logs, etc). They don't have to give back what they don't use because, well, the state doesn't know how much is left over.

That's $1.6 million in un-tracked taxpayer money.
Discovered in my post-#IRE19 information-gathering frenzy:

SB 1 passes 24-14. 

Dems that joined Republicans in passing the bill — Sens. Hollier and Santana.
Sen. Broom (R-Vulcan) says all other states have lower premiums than Michigan. When people say others are looking at MI's system: "I have been hearing that malarkey for 10 years… people are looking at Michigan and they laugh."
Most Dems say they're voting no. Sen. Hollier (D-Detroit) said he would vote yes, though it's not a perfect bill: 

"Are we going to continue to working for a better (bill)? God I hope so. But today we have an opportunity to make some difference."
Debate on SB 1 happening now. Democrats are arguing the bill would not guarantee rate reductions and puts too much trust in auto insurance companies to choose to lower rates themselves.
Sen. Bullock offered an amendment that would tie the bill to a bill that would prohibit consideration of non-driving factors. It failed 16-22. (here's that bill: https://t.co/lWs15yM7kb)
Sen. Geiss offered an amendment to guarantee a 50% rate reduction. It failed 16-22.
The amendment Hollier said would stop red-lining says insurers can't refuse to insure people or limit coverage to people based on their zip code.
The Senate bill that would change auto insurance in Michigan is up on the floor. Two amendments from Democrats — which would eliminate gender as a factor in setting car insurance races and which would prohibit redlining — passed by a voice vote.

A proposed law requires a conviction before forfeiture, with some exemptions. Right now, 1 in 7 cases go conviction-less. https://t.co/tkXObwpLTr
