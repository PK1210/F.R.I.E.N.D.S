On this day,the 50th anniversary of man’s journey to the Moon, we should remind ourselves that our planet Earth, Moon, origin of life, evolution- all are cosmic accidents. It gives us perspective- our planet is lonely and ephemeral; what matters is harmony in nature and society.
I think the ratio of radius squared (earth:moon) is about 13.5; volume ratio is about 50. Mass ratio is 81; therefore gravity ratio is 6. https://t.co/gaN9S4yxwD

Good that TTD is ending VIP culture at the Lord’s abode. It is time that this culture of entitlement of those in power ended; from traffic to queues to police stations we should have real rule of law. Democracy and VIP culture cannot go together. https://t.co/jNaKSSFy7U
The irrational, antiquated policies of govt have distorted incentives leading to overproduction of wheat &amp; rice, and underproduction of other foods - pulses, oil seeds, fruits &amp; vegetables, eggs, fish &amp; meat.

Parties &amp; institutions are busy undermining each other and expanding their turf at the cost of the people.

The Karnataka political drama once again shows how our model has collapsed in states. It is time we elected governors as heads of state &amp; govt, and switched over to proportional representation. Present model with flawed anti-defection provisions undermines democracy &amp; good gov.
Union Budget continues the past trend: core govt functions- rule of law (police, courts&amp;prosecution), infrastructure, education&amp; healthcare are marginalised. Total allocation for all these is much less than interest payments! We need strong pvt sector; but govt must deliver too!

Had two stimulating interactions today; one with IAS trainees &amp; PDCs at Bapatla in the forenoon, another with MsLA &amp; MsLC of AP in Amaravati. If we align private gain with public good, decentralise power, and fuse authority with responsibility we can achieve a great deal.
All of India shares Mumbai’s pain. Nature’s fury cannot be controlled. But even after facing a calamity in 2005, if the storm-water drainage is not improved in 14 years then it is governance failure.

Happy Doctors’ Day to all healthcare professionals. There is no nobler task than eliminating avoidable suffering. In modern human history, the greatest accomplishments are in health- prolonging life span, reducing disease, minimising suffering. Thank you all! No time to rest.
We have to study the feasibility. 1.Regular non-flood flows after meeting deltas’ + north coast’s needs. 2.Technical feasibility 3.Cost-benefit ratio incl annual O&amp;M 4.Cost sharing by TS &amp; AP. 5.Alternatives. If all these work out, then it should be taken up to benefit RS &amp; TS. https://t.co/srd7KDZ63U
If the projects are cost-effective, Godavari waters can meet the requirements of not only Krishna delta, but also NSP Ayacut. Then all inflows into Srisailam can be utilised for the benefit of upland areas of TS and RS region. https://t.co/6dhrmgJWya
Congratulations to govts of AP &amp; TS for their mature, statesmen-like approach to resolve pending issues between the states, and promote harmony among Telugu people. Cooperation on river water sharing is necessary and welcome. Lifting Godavari waters up to NSP seems feasible.
Economic reform is much more than globalisation; it is about economic freedom, choice, competition, limited and effective govt, rule of law &amp; decentralised decision making. As per globalisation, trade apart, technology, ideas, resources &amp; management practices are now global. https://t.co/FY0udixhmP
The nation owes a debt of gratitude to PVN. While 1991 reform was driven by compulsion, PV’s far-sighted, seamless, non-threatening, conciliatory approach paved for competition, choice and growth. The task is unfinished; but we have a chance to fulfil our potential.
A long-overdue, much-needed initiative. MGNREGA funds should be primarily tapped for water harvesting and drought proofing. https://t.co/49ntC6DRFw
In select cases - e.g.: Chennai, Cape Town etc - desalination will help. Cost of water will be about ₹100/Kl. Caped: about $1000/Kld; power: 13-15 units/Kl. Costly, but reliable when there is no major fresh water source in a coastal city. https://t.co/RYs1U6i3HD
Most of our cities are facing storm water drainage problem; drains, water courses &amp; lakes are encroached; natural gradients &amp; contours are ignored while planning. India is still in early phases of urbanisation. It is not too late. We can learn from past. https://t.co/OiuVhiVO8L
Media itself lost the ability for dispassionate, solid analysis; its all about eyeballs &amp; news cycles. Low cost social media can help, provided we as a society are ready to shed prejudice, hatred &amp; anger. Otherwise we will be collectively working hard to undermine public good. https://t.co/hmD9NiteVW
Parties &amp; govts have lost expertise in public management; too busy acquiring/enjoying power, too little ability to govern/improve things. Endless committees have become substitutes to sound Policy. Yashpal, TSR, Kasturirangan, Punchi, ARC, Malimath etc .. no change/improvement.
These were deliberate experiments in one city in each country, and the money/other valuable objects left in public places were tracked unknown to finders. https://t.co/jqHfTTGE28
Some three decades ago &gt;80% finders in India reported and returned money found. We can do better than 45-50%. That China is doing worse is no consolation to us. We need to rebuild mutual trust and respect as a society. https://t.co/L6tOv0nO8V
We should complement GHMC &amp; MWSSB for the proactive citizen engagement. Hyd has 800mm rainfall &amp; access to major rivers. &gt;2000mld is a sizeable quantity.

Southern states, MH, and many regions already have fertility rates of 1.6-1.7. (Replacement level:2.1). But urban population will continue to grow with migration and we have to address infra, traffic &amp; water needs on war footing. https://t.co/2f8nZEomdU

As population rises, water needs too rise. Many small towns &amp; in situ (local) urbanisation are needed. The key is rainwater harvesting &amp; efficient water distribution. With 272L/head, Hyd shd have no shortage, and can have 24 hr supply to all. Chennai may need desalination too. https://t.co/dCs5Cy1dVH
Chennai (popn:8.7m) has real water shortage and is able to supply only 550mld or 65L/head. Hyderabad (popn:7.75m) draws 2109 mld or 272L/head! Yet Hyd has shortages &amp; 5000L is sold at &gt;₹3000!

Healthcare access, female literacy and reduction of infant mortality are the biggest factors in reducing fertility rates. The poorer groups and regions have lower literacy and inadequate healthcare for no fault of theirs. We need to focus on education, MCH and FP services. https://t.co/3FGzigHElk
In the 70’s we bungled badly. Instead of reducing IMR and improving access to health and family planning services, we blamed the people and tried to coerce them (Emergency)!

After reaching TFR of 2.1 or lower, population will grow for some more time and then stabilise or even decline as TFR continues to fall. We are close to 1.4 B now; we will probably reach 1.6 B and then popn will decrease. It’s a huge popn, but we see a plateau soon. https://t.co/R8qasQ9FO2
Fewer children are born today than a generation ago; so we don’t need more schools, we simply need better schooling. Yes, TFR is higher in some states, among Muslims, and Dalits; but it is falling in all social groups.. These high TFR groups are just a decade behind others. https://t.co/T2vBNvNblJ
Already fertility rates (number of children a woman gives birth in her lifetime) in many states are well below 2. In states with high fertility (Bihar, UP etc) also, the rates are falling.

Farm sector needs proven technologies, processing units and retail chains. Only then can we leverage 12% of world’s agri lands and be major exporters. Farm incomes are hampered by govt’s Luddite policies, and 50% of India is reduced to penury. https://t.co/Hx5D8STSzu

We never built a system to enable the bulk of the ppl to understand the link between the vote and their lives. When there is no delivery with the vote, ppl are angry, and parties take advantage of poverty and offer money; ppl accept it to maximise short term gain. Vicious cycle. https://t.co/KXFgaLQzfA
Media, parties and informed citizens must start a debate and mobilise public opinion. Status quo is not an option. If vote buying, short term freebies without incomes and divisions become sure vote winners, we are in trouble as a society and economy. We must stem the rot. https://t.co/pOg6aMj3F3
Parties, media and many of us are lost in the power struggle and are treating elections as a 20-20 match or horse race. We are winning battles  for power, but losing the war for the future of India. Vajpayeeji often talked about it. Plutocracy and kleptocracy are holding us back. https://t.co/5t88Dwonwt
Distribution of money to voters has gone out of control. Most ‘winnable’ candidates and parties now resort to it. Large spend has become entrance fee! EC is in denial. When Gopinath Munde talked about it years ago, EC sent him notice! We need PR to transform politics.
All of us share the grief of Sri Lanka in the wake of the terrible terrorist attacks targeting Christians celebrating Easter Sunday. The idyllic country has recently recovered from decades of LTTE terrorism. Let us hope Sri Lanka will soon vanquish terror and peace will prevail.
Politicians criticise each other, contest elections and receive people’s mandate. Officials are appointed by a competitive, independent process, and are accountable to superiors and to government. Judiciary appointing itself and remaining  unaccountable dents its credibility. https://t.co/fSgf2ZHYVA
If there is a judicial standards and accountability law with a permanent mechanism to independently investigate complaints against sitting judges, these issues can be addressed effectively. Judges cannot defend themselves. We need Judicial independence with accountability. https://t.co/aOMJ3mlyYx
What is happening to BJP? First Sadhvi Pragya is made a candidate. She may have grievances, and has the right to defend her rights. But calling Hemanth Karkare an anti-national and rejoicing his violent death while on duty in the hands of terrorists! Is nothing worthy of respect? https://t.co/E5lYW5nxSD
The election fight in Andhra Pradesh finally boils down to competition between private money efficiently distributed to voters vs freebies with public money efficiently delivered. Somebody has to win at the polls; but the people and soul of democracy have lost. We have a crisis.
We must grow the economy and create sufficient jobs to productively employ the large number of young people joining the labour force. Education and skills are necessary, but not sufficient. But without quality education there is no growth or escape from poverty and caste. https://t.co/q8N6Rgp0WZ
A very lucid representation of depressing data on educational outcomes. Sad that quality school education and healthcare without out-of-pocket expenditure burden on the families has not found place in all the campaigns/discourse/media ‘debates’ during elections. https://t.co/Xj6MHiY8It

A very uplifting story. Strong families, access to technology &amp; entrepreneurship are driving progress &amp; prosperity.

2/2 On the other hand, Congress has no viable road map for all the aforementioned key areas of governance. And it is indulging in reckless populism and fiscal profligacy. Neither offers hope for governance reform. Our best bet is vote for true federalism and autonomy to cities.
1/2We, the voters, have a difficult choice. On the one hand BJP squandered a priceless opportunity to transform India; none of the fundamentals- service delivery, rule of law, education, healthcare, decentralisation and agriculture have been addressed. Institutions are weakened.
Unions total revenue (tax+non tax) in 2019-20 BE is ₹19.78 lakh crores, or about 10.5% gdp. Tax revenue alone is ₹17.05 lakh crores or 8% gdp. But we must add revenues of states and local govts also. Then tax, gdp ratio is close to 17%. https://t.co/yelDeR1jQs
There is no realistic model to enhance tax-gdp ratio in India substantially. Apart from hurting savings rates, people will resist higher taxes given the ubiquitous corruption and abysmally poor infrastructure and service delivery. The state cannot tax more without outcomes. https://t.co/pHqc88t7fq
Our tax-gdp ratio is 16.8%, and is comparable to low middle income countries: Egypt-15.8,Indonesia-12,Malaysia - 15,Pak-11%,Philippines-14.4. Even China (20.1),Hongkong (13)Singapore (14.2)have low tax-gdp ratio and deliver much better infra, edu &amp; health.https://t.co/hBngnTzTyu
You may disagree with Jean Dreze; but you cannot but admire his compassion, commitment and scholarship. Arguments have to be based on evidence and reason, not on emotion and prejudice. https://t.co/HjL7sdWfY6
Patriotism is not the monopoly of those in power, and those who criticise a government or a policy are not anti-national. In fact true patriotism demands that you focus on larger public good, and put the nation above parties. Pity that public debate has become corrosive in India. https://t.co/zxp62WLQRX
@Tejasvi_Surya Hearty congratulations! I hope a new breed of public-spirited young citizens like you will be nurtured and promoted to leadership positions by all parties, and you will be engines of change in our political culture and governance. All the very best.
Given our current political climate, freebies are unstoppable. Can we cap all consumption subsidies at &lt;15% of total public spend; club them all &amp; transfer lump sum cash directly; and focus seriously on infra, edu outcomes &amp; healthcare? Time is running out. A modest proposal.
Poverty, bad governance, bad policies &amp; votes are an explosive combination. Poor delivery perpetuates poverty; resultant voter anger leads to freebies at the cost of infra, edu, health &amp; rule of law. That leads to fiscal crisis, more poverty, inflation &amp; anger. A vicious cycle!
After transfers to states &amp; debt servicing, GoI retains only about ₹7.5 trillion for all union spend. There simply is no money in the kitty. Many states have very little left after wages &amp; freebies. Parties are behaving as if there is no life after elections. Deep fiscal crisis!
Rule of law and justice are at the heart of democracy. Mere ‘vote’ and ‘shout’ do not constitute democracy. Police, prosecution, courts - all need massive reform to establish rule of law and justice. Can we rise above parties and focus on what matters?https://t.co/whLI37jOVR
With officials like these, India does not need enemies! Can someone put sense into them about the art of diplomacy and protecting India’s interests? https://t.co/UNZoySlVYr
We are all with you in this fight. We must bring back civility and reason in public discourse. People who behave viciously must be punished; or else the decline will be precipitous. Proud of you for not giving up. https://t.co/ND8OcQd6rk

The first report of 2nd ARC has dealt with RTI and OSA comprehensively, and gave a practical road map to reconcile both. SARC gave specific, practical recommendations to amend law and the CCA rules.

I hope GoI has examined it carefully. We need to cover all bases and anticipate more problems from a mercurial Trump administration on trade front.

From Boston airport I drove straight to Windham city library, NH, and picked up the city annual report and  a couple of books.

Give back VOICE to legislators; now they are captives of party leaders. Executive makes laws and budgets, and legislature is merely a rubber stamp as long as govt has majority. Notionally govt is appointed and held to account by legislature; in reality govt controls legislators.
The anti-defection provisions (10th Schedule) made the situation much worse. Now legislature is our version of Loya Jirga, not  a deliberative and legislative body! We need to make whip applicable only to No Confidence Motion, and give back vice to legislators https://t.co/oO5AwKJgZ6
