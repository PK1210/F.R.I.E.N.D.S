Nay, the "complete mystery" is how one may know the secrets of Stonehenge, as I do, and yet retain a thin shred of sanity. That's another big burden of mine actually.
"Unlike those other monuments, though, Stonehenge is more or less a complete mystery." I almost envy the cosmic naïveté of that sentiment. Alas I am burdened with the eldritch wisdom of the ancients.

@jeremypgordon That's exactly right. You just articulated it perfectly.
And then when he won in 2011, and was, finally, good enough! It was my favorite championship run ever. It's such a bummer he's leaving. It's such an amazing thing he had the career he did. What a player.
And the combo of awkwardness and effectiveness somehow made his big-time loses -- to the Warriors in the 2007 playoffs and Heat in the 2006 finals -- even more crushing. Like, he was so good! But not quite good enough ...
I can't even really explain why, but I've always loved Dirk Nowitzki. His game always seemed so awkwardly effective, which is about how effective anyone can reasonably expect to be. But he was VERY effective!
