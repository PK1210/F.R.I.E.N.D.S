@MrRathna! Irreverent, edgy and relentlessly entertaining!! You are a rock-star! 

And @KVijayKartik is a monster! He has pulled off something nearly impossible: finding humanity in nudity. Not even a single frame felt vulgar! #Aadai
#Aadai plays out like feverish naked-nightmare of a stubborn girl who finally understands what it means to concede defeat. Fires on all cylinders. Must watch!
@Amala_ams, where the hell were you all these days? Such vulnerability &amp; cockiness at the same time. You are a champion!
#Aadai from today evening 6 PM! Breaking barriers &amp; stereotypes! https://t.co/Pl6k1uDTUa
