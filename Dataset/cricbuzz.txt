Precariously*-placed
Botham later said the England wicketkeeper, Bob Taylor, also had a small punt on the home side.
Lillee later said: ‚ÄúBloody lucky innings. I expected to get him virtually every ball." However, Botham's innings would be etched in the folklore of cricket's history as one of the greatest.
With Botham in the mood, he skipped down the track and cracked a sumptuous six off Alderman. Benaud described the stroke: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even bother looking for that. It‚Äôs gone into the confectionery stall and out again.‚Äù
Botham was in his zone and said to Dilley: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs give it some humpty.‚Äù On occasions, he left all 3 stumps to thwack. He also cut, drove and pulled with swagger. Alderman found a thick edge, but it flew over the cordon. Lillee too induced the edge, but it kept flying over slips
Even then, England were way behind in the game. At lunch, Ladbrokes proceeded to offer 500-1 odds on Australia losing the Test. Interestingly, Lillee (¬£10) and Rodney Marsh (¬£5) bet on England.
Tendulkar, who played 200 Tests and holds the record for the most number of Test runs and Test hundreds, became the sixth Indian batsman to be given the honour. 
https://t.co/ynGZ8qC9EE
At 5 for 105, Botham walked out. He started with an immaculate off drive off Alderman. The next stroke was even better - a lofted drive that scurried away to the fence. Australia had four slip fielders stationed, but that turned out to be Botham's day.
There was drama in the middle as Willey, the enterprising batsman, cracked a couple of fours over gully. Lillee wanted a fly slip but Hughes refused. The 2nd time it flew over the cordon, with a piercing glare, Lillee looked at Hughes and he gave in. The next ball, Willey was out
Botham, who had picked up a six-for in the first essay, gave warning signs of what was to come with a brisk fifty in the first innings. ENG, who were made to follow on, then found themselves preciously-placed. Boycott resisted for about four hours before he was lbw to Alderman.
The epic at Leeds: After Australia had accumulated 401 in the 1st essay, the visiting captain, Kim Hughes, had said: ‚ÄúFour hundred is worth a thousand on this pitch." Lillee, Alderman and Lawson then used the conditions well to bundle England out  for just 174.
Thread: #OnThisDay, in 1981, Sir Ian Botham composed a believe-it-or-not 148-ball 149 at Leeds to script a jailbreak v AUS. He stitched stands of 117 with Dilley, 67 with Old and 37 with Willis to turn the game on its head. Willis, eventually, powered the hosts to a 18-run win https://t.co/IOjt8elxVr

'IT IS COMING HOME'

After 44 years of effort, despair and disappointment, England are the World Champions 

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final https://t.co/fLUY2g40nf
Jofra Archer - the nominated bowler for England in the Super Over

For NZ, Guptill and Neesham will lead the chase

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final
3 1 4 1 2 4 - England make 15 runs in the Super Over

New Zealand need 16 to become #CWC19 champions

#ENGvNZ #CWC19Final
It's Buttler and Stokes who will open for England in the Super Over

For NZ, Boult will bowl the over

We will have a super over to decide the #CWC19 champions

#ENGvNZ #CWC19Final
Neesham has his say once again - Jofra Archer swings lustily and loses his stumps

It's all on Stokes now - England need 15 from the final over; Boult to bowl

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final
Is this the match changing moment?

Boult takes the catch off Stokes and inadvertently steps onto the ropes with the ball in hand

It's on for England; need 16 runs from 8 balls

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final
Neesham keeps his team ahead. Plunkett goes for the big shot, holes out to long-off, OUT for 10

England need 22 runs from 9 balls

Lockie Ferguson is done for #CWC19 with the ball

10-0-50-3

England need 34 runs from the last three overs

#ENGvNZ #CWC19Final
Lockie Ferguson is taking New Zealand closer to that maiden World Cup crown. Woakes is the 6th wicket to fall, OUT for 2. ENG: 203 for 6, need 39 from 23 balls

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final
Another twist in what is turning out to be a cracking #CWC19 final. Buttler slices the drive and is well held by substitute fielder, Tim Southee, OUT for a 60-ball 59. England still need 46 runs from 31 balls

#ENGvNZ #CWC19Final
A nail-biting end at Lord's. England need 59 runs from 42 balls. New Zealand need wickets

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final
The English fans begin to find their voices at Lord's as Buttler and Stokes take centre-stage.

England need 72 runs from the last 10 overs. New Zealand need 6 wickets

#ENGvNZ #CWc19 #CWC19Final
#CWC2019 saw some spectacular performances from players across sides. Watch @ImZaheer pick his XI from the tournament and name his captain and wicket-keeper. What would your World Cup XI look like?

#RohitSharma #KaneWilliamson https://t.co/jwrrmyrbpC
Another pivotal moment in the #ENGvNZ #CWC19 final. Henry thinks he has Buttler LBW and implores his captain to use the DRS. Turns out to be a poor call

50-run partnership between Stokes and Buttler. Can they set-up a mouthwatering finish to #CWC19?

#ENGvNZ #CWC19Final
Colin de Grandhomme - the unsung hero with the ball for New Zealand

10-2-25-1

England need 131 runs from 21 overs

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final
Kane Williamson turns to Neesham and his bowler doesn't disappoint him. Stunning catch at deep point from Ferguson, Morgan OUT for 9. ENG: 86 for 4

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final
Pace does the trick for Lockie Ferguson and Jonny Bairstow can't handle him. Chops it back onto his stumps, OUT for 36. ENG: 71 for 3

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWCFinal19
Joe Root could never get going and he falls to Colin de Grandhomme, OUT for 7. ENG: 59 for 2

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final

Matt Henry gets the wicket for New Zealand. Jason Roy runs out of luck, gets an edge to the keeper. OUT for 17. ENG: 28 for 1 

#ENGvNZ #CWC19 #CWC19Final
Jason Roy survives New Zealand's review for a first ball non-LBW call. Replays return with umpire's call on hitting the stumps

Colin de Grandhomme and Tom Latham fall in quick succession. New Zealand reach 232 for 7 with 9 balls remaining

England have won four while New Zealand have triumphed five times when the two sides have played against each other in World Cups. Who will emerge victorious and lift the trophy in the big final? #CWC19 #EngvNZ https://t.co/u1vdMs8azK
JUST IN: Kolkata Knight Riders part ways with head coach Jacques Kallis and assistant coach Simon Katich. #IPL
England's top order against New Zealand's new-ball attack. It was what held them up in their respective semifinal encounters. 

But on the day, the better of the two could be what will define their maiden world cup triumph. https://t.co/pfQ0WZdloh #ENGvsNZ #CWC19

"It means a huge amount to me and everybody in the changing room. It's a culmination of four years of hard work, dedication, a lot of planning and it presents a huge opportunity to go on and try and win a World Cup" - Morgan #CWC19Final #CWC19 #ENGvNZ  https://t.co/pbz8NzLEgc https://t.co/XmUuduWAGm
"It was disappointing to watch what they did with Rayudu. He was in the contention for the World Cup."

The reason the "Jofradamus" shtick has gained traction is due to the manner he fired off random observations. A second-screen experience at warp speed and, as such, his timeline is a treasure-trove for a variety of situations, says @Vitu_E https://t.co/kzVELObetW #CWC19 https://t.co/a1i18zkZQJ
