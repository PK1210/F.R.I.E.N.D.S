@roadrunnerz45 Thanks for your support ✨
@MoniqueSchafter Thank you @MoniqueSchafter! It’s an assisted walk to show it’s ok to ask for help on a difficult journey, and knowing you have support gives you strength to continue. I walk up to 40km/day, but the support vehicle helps me when I can’t continue, and helped me cross the Nullarbor.
@SkinnyKATH I get to WA Parliament House ON August 6th but will be walking around the Perth metro area from 1-6 August 👍
@Meshel_Laurie Thank you so much @Meshel_Laurie - it’s these messages of support that keep me going ✨

@sm_shep Heartbreaking. I’m so sorry for your mum. We need to make things better, and I believe that we can. Stay strong and make sure you speak up about your experience to your loved ones, and most importantly, your local MP.
@tonywalker1 You’re very kind. Thanks very much - it’s all for my mum who was the bravest one of all.
@andrewforbes5 So sorry to hear that your family’s been touched by cancer too. Sometimes there are simply people that modern medicine can’t save: my mum was one of them. This is why we need better options for people like them. Stay strong.
I know that @kymaher will lead South Australia forward with courage and compassion as Chairperson of SA’s End of Life Choices Enquiry.

@WeglitterLee Congratulations on your amazing advocacy work, and never give up. I don't speak Korean, my friend Youn has helped me to translate. (Weglitter님의 안락사 지지 활동에 감사드리며 또 축하드립니다. 절대 포기 하지 말아주세요. 저는 한국어를 할 수 없지만 친구에게 번역을 부탁 했습니다).”
@WeglitterLee I believe that one day, better options will be available for everyone in the world. (저는 언젠가는 전 세계의 모든 사람들에게 선택권이 주어질것이라고 믿습니다. 그리고 지구상의 모든 사람들이 함께 그 결과를 이루어 낼것을 바라고 있습니다.)
@WeglitterLee Thankyou for spreading mum's message around the world. (제 이야기에 관한 Weglitter님의 블로그 포스팅을 제 페이스북페이지 - Belinda’s Brave Walk - 에 나누었습니다. 저를 서포트 해주시는 많은 분들께서 Weglitter님으로 인해서 제이야기를 전세계로 퍼져나가게 되어 큰 감동을 받았습니다.)
@WeglitterLee I can see you are very passionate about this issue - did this issue affect a family member of yours, and is that why you are such an active advocate? (안락사에 관하여 높은 관심을 갖고 계신것 같은데요. 혹시 본인 혹은 가족분들로 인하여 안락사를 지지하게 되신건가요?)
@WeglitterLee 안녕하세요 Weglittee님. 저는 벨린다입니다. 

"Thank you very much for the article you wrote about me, you are amazing! (제 이야기를 블로그에 포스팅 해주셔서 너무 감사합니다.)
Just came across @AliAbdaal’s YouTube video, “Legalising Assisted Suicide” - although it doesn’t apply directly to Australia, it was an interesting insight to what the UK perspective is on this important issue of #assisteddying https://t.co/Dr3TXCzloi
“Belinda, what is your message for people who oppose voluntary assisted dying in Western Australia?”  Here’s how I responded during a live radio interview with ABC Radio Perth yesterday (skip to 09:23): https://t.co/P0vlNT9S8d #assisteddying #dyingwithdignity
Sent in by a supporter today: “Tracing Belinda’s steps as she paves the way for Voluntary Assisted Dying.” Unbelievable ✨ #assisteddying #dyingwithdignity https://t.co/nxJtJllgYh

@buntine_bob Thanks Bob &amp; Ann! Maybe I’ll run into you on the way 😊
Max was driving home when he saw me walking with my white rose. He said: “I’ve seen you on TV. Your walk means a great deal to me. Can I walk with you?” It's important to remember #Assisteddying laws affect real people like Max #bebravewa #belindaswalk
