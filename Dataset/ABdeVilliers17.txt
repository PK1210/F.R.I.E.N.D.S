@landu_vuyo I fully agree! Serena is a true Champion!!! I have the world of respect for her and what’s she’s achieved!! I still feel she made a mistake at the US open, that’s my opinion. Osaka deserved better with her first major win and Serena could’ve handled the situation better.
2 majors in a row! This time she’s been “allowed” to enjoy the moment. Much deserved #OsakaKvitova #AustralianOpen

@centrecourtcc @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Thank goodness. We’re friends again. I was just sad for the young girl. I hope she wins another 15 majors so she can forget about what happened with her 1st
@JohnnyTheSeal @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ That is my point!
@nahab_sg @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ @serenawilliams Serena’s behaviour was appalling and took the spotlight away from a 20 year old girl who played the game of her life!
@saltyman007 @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Spot on
@premeshshaw @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ True
@Joellen12784676 @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ I have been through that plenty of times! Been called a cheat too. I kept my head down and moved on. Never took the shine away from someone who outperformed me/us on the day
@Lenn_Moleko @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Well said
@centrecourtcc @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Very well spoken, AFTER she behaved badly
@Frayne375 @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ True, not the first time she has done this. Always happens when she starts losing
@AmandaRinquest @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ I didn’t blame anyone but ourselves for that loss, I gave the opponent all the credit.
@Philventer5 @tebza2r @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Correct
@AndreaHan09 @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ It was nice of her to do that, but it was too late. Osaka had to win her first major with tears in her eyes, and those were not tears of joy
@SonjaJonker4 @LaurenLCoetzee @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Korrek
@LaurenLCoetzee @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ I did, it was too late. She probably did it out of embarrassment, cause she was the reason for all the booing
@LaurenLCoetzee @centrecourtcc @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Ps. Always been a HUGE admirer of Serena, still is. BUT, I did not agree with the show she put on, allowing a “bad” umpiring decision take away her opponents moment in the sun. Her speech afterwards was nice, but too late. My tweet was all about feeling sorry for Osaka
@LaurenLCoetzee @centrecourtcc @KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Too late. Damage was done
@KAndersonATP @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ No one deserves to win your 1st major with the sound of booing around! Serena should have handled the situation better. Give the young girl her moment in the spotlight. All professional athletes have moments where we feel hard done by, u keep your head down &amp; try to fight it out
It’s time for @thePSLt20. So, there’s going to be a party in February?
