people: you're so quiet THAT'S BECAUSE I DONT FUCKING LIKE YOU
row row row your boat gently away from me
I gave a fuck once. It was horrible.
Look at all the happy couples. I hate them.
running seems like a great idea until you actually start running
I have learned that pleasing everyone is impossible, but pissing everyone off is easy and fun as hell.
How to end your essay: "You feel me?"
Jack&amp;Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.Jack fell down &amp; broke his crown &amp; NOW HE'S LYING ON THE COLD HARD GROUND *goat screams*
Roses are red, i hate you, die.
me: why am i so fat me: eats 17 pizzas me: eats 49 tubs of ice cream me: eats entire family me:why
It takes about 2.9 seconds for me to go from "this is the best day ever" to "I want to stab every person on planet Earth."
just dropped my new single it's me i'm single
*goes back to school after a long break* how do i hold a pen
I been putting a lot of thought into it and I just don't think being an adult is gonna work for me.
That was actually really funny. But I don't like you. Therefore I shall not laugh.
The world's population has now reached 7 billion... I like 12 of you.
Do you ever just wanna grab someone by the shoulders, look them deep in the eyes and whisper, "No one gives a fuck."
the difference between pizza and your opinion is that i asked for pizza
