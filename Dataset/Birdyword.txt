@interfluidity @MidwestDeplore @mattyglesias @lymanstoneky @passivelurker Yep! More or less. I've got a list of papers on it now - just on my phone, this is the one I have to hand https://t.co/89QcKZqo48
@IronEconomist @interfluidity @lymanstoneky @passivelurker I really would like to write a lot more on this! It's one of those awkward subject areas that sits half inside and half outside my beat.
@IronEconomist @interfluidity @lymanstoneky @passivelurker I agree, and if I thought that was the cost that would be fine. I don't.
@MidwestDeplore @interfluidity @mattyglesias @lymanstoneky @passivelurker I don't think it's all going to blow up, I don't think Chinese capitalism is market-oriented enough for that. I think it's going to have a deleterious impact on future productivity growth.
@IronEconomist @interfluidity @lymanstoneky @passivelurker Lot of the rapidly put up apartments have a shelf life of 20-30 years. As anything other than speculative activity it makes no sense. And as I say, many not in the right place
@interfluidity @mattyglesias @lymanstoneky @passivelurker Happy to send on research but it seems to redirect a huge amount of otherwise frontier/high productivity private biz activity into real estate. I'm pretty convinced by the dark productivity forecasts
@IronEconomist @interfluidity @lymanstoneky @passivelurker This is not really true. National vacancy rate is over a fifth! It's at Spain-like levels, where Spain at least has a lot of holiday homes
@interfluidity @mattyglesias @lymanstoneky @passivelurker I think the high US unemployment was an avoidable crime but this might be long term worse, it's taking CN off the Asian success story path. They won't get rich if they keep on IMO.
@interfluidity @mattyglesias @lymanstoneky @passivelurker Nope, almost definitely not - issue with the housing is that it's often in entirely the wrong places (and little to no rental market in most, so huge speculative behaviour on the part of local govt and households)

@timdayipper I didn't see the bricks, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just mean that the vast majority of the gas fired was into crowds of people who were not throwing anything, they'd clearly made the decision beforehand to clear any road occupations far more aggressively
@timdayipper I was there FWIW, I stand by this. Some protesters were clearly being violent just before the first round of gas, the many subsequent rounds were just an indiscriminate escalation https://t.co/61ya8149sz
@timdayipper Day one as in 6/12?
Also, France (as with most every other country in the world!) is considerably more violent than HK in general.
I think this is true. I also think that this represents, as far as I know it, roughly the status quo for the French police (as it would it many western forces), compared to a clear escalation in tactical violence for the HK police. https://t.co/TR4BmbKbm1

@JackPScott @dandolfa Whether policy needs to be set that way *now* is not quite the same question, but given as I say the absence of much proper evidence of the damage it's doing I'm pretty sanguine about it.
@JackPScott @dandolfa I just dont agree at all! This is the tried, tested and miserably failed liquidationist logic. The economic history seems pretty clear to me here, concerted economic policy responses, particularly from CBs, end recessions and generate recoveries.
@michaellebowitz @JackPScott @dandolfa Seen what wealth inequality looks like in Japan? We've been talking about crazy asset prices for a decade now but the looming catastrophe just keeps being kicked down the road!

@PaulJDavies @jmackin2 @galen211 Yep certainly fair, though I find the second home purchases a bit worrying, and the rental yields, and the lack of a secondary market. Depends whether these things end up developing and I'm v sceptical these days.
@PaulJDavies @jmackin2 @galen211 Ah right gotcha, no I don't believe resales are included, could be wrong. For China I dont imagine it would change the picture too much since the resale market is so comparatively underdeveloped
@PaulJDavies @jmackin2 @galen211 In GDP, you mean?
@jmackin2 @galen211 I'm not sure they should invest more, though Studwell-type view of Asian development successes and failures strongly suggests that the limiting factor is too much credit growth particularly into real estate. Which makes the middle-upper middle income bulge there interesting
@DrJamesCMorgan I dont think the paper is actually great for the doomy aspect, their faith that price growth is consumption-led, given the other evidence that the relationship works the other way round. I'd never seen that chart though.
