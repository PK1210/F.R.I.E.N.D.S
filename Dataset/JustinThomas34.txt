Even as a competitor and trying to beat the guy every week, sometimes I have to step back and realize how great @McIlroyRory is for golf. How he handles the spotlight, the highs, the lows, his social life, the fans, his golf, everything.. it’s awesome to watch
Haha great call... Radar is the man. They’re both great for their own reasons which makes them fun and enjoyable to hear call golf 👌🏽 https://t.co/mwHTseNEMV

Absolutely insane. What unreal golfing by Collin and Matt on that back nine and congrats to @matthew_wolff5 on his first of I’m sure many victories on the @PGATOUR. What a tournament
Really impressed how well both Wolff and Morikawa are playing and handling the situation right now. Whether you’ve won 0 times or 70, it’s still hard to win! And they’re acting like they’ve been there plenty of times. Impressive!

There’s nothing worse than missing the weekend at a major.. especially the @usopengolf when anything can happen! Pebble is PERFECT and has been such a great set up thus far. Getting firm and will show the best players come weeks end. Well done @USGA

What a win for @BKoepka. No reason to compare to TW, any of the greats, anything... respect this insane run he’s on and applaud him for it. Congrats bro 👏🏽
What a Sunday at Bethpage...DJ played some ridiculously good golf on a brutally difficult day to even give BK a run for his money. Big bogey saves on 11 and 14 will probably go untalked about, but they were huuuuge in my eyes. Couple more pars and this thing is over!

@FIGJAM83 @JasonSobelTAN Money is just a bonus. I like playing for trophies 🏆
@FIGJAM83 @JasonSobelTAN I’m just watching golf and using twitter to share my thoughts while watching brooks play lights out 🤷🏽‍♂️
@JasonSobelTAN Why it needs to be talked about more on telecast (in my opinion) how much of an impact wind makes.. 5-10 mph can influence a putt massively let alone a 15-25 mph wind
@LukeDonald Hahaha yes!! Luke I think you and I just need to sit together when not playing and live tweet everything or start a show. We could be onto something...

Ok, John. https://t.co/OF2Br17yRV
Is anybody else as shocked as I am every time somebody in the NHL deflects a shot in the air for it to go in? I understand that it’s some luck... but every time I see it I’m mind blown how freakishly difficult that seems 🤯
Just now seeing this... couldn’t have said it better @notthefakeSVP. Whether you’re 2000 in the world or 5 in the world, those bad thoughts can creep in your head... @maxhoma23 might have handled it better than anybody in the world would’ve. Really great listen 👇🏽 https://t.co/HmqmI7tm81

@Alabamafan40 Bakers bay
@tniccum3 I really struggled on the greens. Was probably the best I’ve ever driven the ball and my irons were great. If I had a halfway decent putting week I truly think I would’ve won by a couple. I’m getting close though!
