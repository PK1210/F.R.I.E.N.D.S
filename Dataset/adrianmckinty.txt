Today is the fifth anniversary that a little rescue cat called Jet came into our lives. He became the star of two of my Sean Duffy novels &amp; although he‚Äôs a wee bit bitey &amp; ornery he‚Äôs the greatest cat in the world. https://t.co/LJ651AK8zn

@biblioracle Yes! I 100% agree. I once put a joke in a Duffy novel that only my little brother could possibly get and he still hasn't read the bloody book! The chapter 77 thing at the end of The Chain was in there entirely for me...
@biblioracle Yes! That's why I loved your piece brother. Hilarious! In the Duffy books I allow myself a lot more jokes but I know that wd be entirely the wrong tone here....still there is the odd moment of black Belfast humour
@biblioracle although you're completely right, enough is as good as a feast...I had to battle my copyeditor to keep Dutch Angle in. She wrote me a stern warning note. I emailed your piece to her this morning and she replied 
"See?!!!!"
@biblioracle Yup. 
And all the Lovecraft stuff (there is for example no Miskatonic River in the real Massachusetts). 
The TS Eliot, Frost, Robert Lowell refs
All the Borges stuff.
etc. 
You don't want to go overboard but you're allowed to have some fun even in a taut thriller...

@biblioracle I loved your piece in the Trib. Effing hilarious, man. Dutch Angle is my wee tribute to Carol Reed whose Odd Man Out was filmed in Belfast largely in DA's. Does it belong in a thriller? I think you're allowed to slip in some of yr personal mythology here and there...

@book_bint @orionbooks @Waterstones I'm so glad you liked Rachel. It was important to me that Rachel was an ordinary person w "no special skills" or anything like that. And I knew she wd do some pretty terrible things &amp; I wasn't sure readers wd still root for her after that...
brilliant story from @TheRealEGS about changing your mind about who you are. 100% agree w this! If you want to reject the narrative that has been imposed upon you reject it &amp; carve out a new story for yourself: https://t.co/TrJe4jxOL3
@book_bint @orionbooks @Waterstones the 77 chapters thing was something I was planning for a while but I couldn't make it work in any other book, fortunately by the 1/2 way point of The Chain I knew the chapter count was going to be in the 70s....
