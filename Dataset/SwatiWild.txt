As one of only 17 mega diverse countries in the world. Yet we stand incredibly vulnerable to species loss and climate change. And still no change, no plan and only more business first decisions. It's a disgrace.
When are we ever going to treat the wonders that keep us alive like water, clean air, the forests and the ocean as the life givers they are? When will it become priority number 1? 177 out of 180 on the environment index is India's  rank. We have been blessed
So the much touted 'clean Kumbh' was not so clean after all. The river is so filthy that it could cause an epidemic says the NGT. The Namame Ganga scheme is a complete failure and now they want to link rivers. Water is life. Everything else is irrelevant.

I did however go on to say that there was DNA evidence on five of the victims. I also said I believe she should have been removed but that the operation was done in a completely shoddy manner. As I have said from the beginning in my articles https://t.co/eIOF2sybJ4
@ndtv @LRC_NDTV The rest of my sentence was that there was evidence with DNA that she killed five people. That is also in my articles on her

@thedoctorine @BittuSahgal We are scum. No question. With the situation the way it was however she had to be removed but it was complete lack of management and lack of any kind of policy that lead to this situation in the first place. Now her cubs have to be captured. It's just tragic
