Tips for ~forwarding~ deal-flow:

1. Are you investing?

2. Are you investing?

3. Who is this from/do you know them?

3. CC vs BCC groups (don’t)

4. Add to the forwarded email. Most: “Let me know if to intro!”

Guiding principle: people should look forward to your next email 💫
Tips for sending deal-flow 💸 https://t.co/GfkNIq97WB
