@VMSFMom @houseandhens I don't think it's about the people who are *actually* hard sticks, those people have the right to say that 😂 but it's a common thing for people to avoid a new IV or crucial blood work by saying this after hearing it from an other patient :/

@hey_im_tori Yeah my hospital pays the least for techs in this area, we get almost 13, and that's with 3 years experience 😭 we cap out at 17, which is totally unfair. But I may look into another department, we'll see!😊

I'm so over being a tech. Working short staffed, for less money than a cashier at a retail store, just to be used and abused and forgotten about. 

I thought I could make it one more year until I'm a nurse, but now I'm not so sure.

Maybe I need a change of scenery??
@NICUNursey_ I have this problem in clinical, we'd be on the floor for 8 hours and either be ignored or no one would want our help because they don't trust us. Meanwhile, 90% of us are LPNs and techs so we have SOME kind of experience with hands on care and are more than willing to help :/
