MB: We lost two matches in the ISL - once when Pritam played for us and once when he didn't play for us. So that doesn't matter now. Its a neutral venue and both teams start fresh. #HeroSuperCup
Pradeep Mohanraj: Knockout matches are tough. We are prepared for more than 90 minutes also. We play against a tough side. #HeroSuperCup
MB: We lost twice to ATK this season but that doesn't matter now. We have practised well for this game and we know how they play so we have made adjustments as per that. #HeroSuperCup
MB: We came with the target of winning the Super Cup. Tomorrow will be a tough game against a team that we know well. We have to give our best. #HeroSuperCup
In one day, we take on @ATKFC in the Quarter Final of the #HeroSuperCup!
