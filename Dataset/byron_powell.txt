Year 1 findings were previously published in @ImplementSci https://t.co/O2BqJhOyvx
Pre-imp. strategies in “training/educating,” “interactive assistance,” &amp; “building stakeholder relationships” clusters more likely assoc. w/ tx starts in Y1. Strategies in “evaluative &amp; iterative” &amp; “adapting &amp; tailoring” clusters more likely associated w/ treatment starts in Y2.
Total number of treatment starts significantly positively correlated with total number of strategies endorsed in both yrs. In Y1 &amp; Y2, respectively, 28 and 26 strategies significantly associated with treatment starts; 12 strategies overlapped both years.
