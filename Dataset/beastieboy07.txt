The trend of getting an unconventional spinner to open the bowling at @jbairstow21 might have started with @lionsdenkxip using Mujeeb to get him out early during #IPL12 #ENGvPAK #cwc19 @cricbuzz #shadabkhan
The #wcuponwheels got the thumbs up today from former England batting mainstay @AllanLamb294 in Northampton. Full interview up shortly, make sure you subscribe to

Worcester was where the #wcuponwheels rolled into on Day 3, &amp; after being charmed by the New Road county ground &amp; @WorcsCCC‚Äôs history we also found the origins of Worcestershire sauce. And I picked @BCBtigers to make the semis https://t.co/adjsR4yht9 via @YouTube @Gampa_cricket
RT @Gampa_cricket: Day 3 in #wcuponwheels @beastieboy07 and I visit Worcester to soak in the scenic County ground, find out about its glori‚Ä¶
We overcame flash mobs, protests and narrow city roads to reach the Bristol county ground and between boos and jeers saw Australia open their #CWC19 campaign against Afghanistan https://t.co/UBgeXxK5Gm via @YouTube #wcupwonwheels @Gampa_cricket #AFGvAUS
A battle between a heavyweight pugilist &amp; a bare-knuckled boxer is what #AFGvAUS resembled when the Afghans batted &amp; also revealed why Australia need to tighten up their bowling in the middle overs to go the distance in #CWC19 ‚Å¶‚Å¶‚Å¶@cricbuzz‚Å©  https://t.co/FZx5lDnjPa
If Australia continue to bowl the way they have in the middle-overs here, West Indies will start favourites against them next week at Trent Bridge @cricbuzz #CWC19 #AFGvAUS
Day 2: From Banksy to Bungee to BRRRistol. Here‚Äôs a lot more about a city known as the Birthplace of America https://t.co/VppnyFEyIA via @YouTube #wcuponwheels with @Gampa_cricket #CWC19

At Cheddar, it‚Äôs not just the cheese that matures, even cricket careers do. And @Gampa_cricket and I visited the club which witnessed the beginning of the @josbuttler story https://t.co/vsFJG4lj40 via @YouTube #wcuponwheels #cwc19
One Australian fan already seems to have booked his seat in the posh apartment complex bordering the Bristol County Ground for #AUSvAFG #cwc19 @cricbuzz https://t.co/Bye68cSzNC
Day 1 was a day of many firsts for #wcuponwheels from park rides to being Bristolian enough to have cider at noon while keeping an eye on #engvsa with a little forecasting on the #WIvPAK clash https://t.co/nnksOogpXU via @YouTube #CWC19
RT @Gampa_cricket: First day done. The game might have lost its fizz, but @beastieboy07 and I enjoyed the match from various vantage points‚Ä¶
@MartinPSpencer @Gampa_cricket @englandcricket @candmclub Haha thanks a lot Martin. How well we read and understand those instructions will define how successful our journey is of course. And I do hope the @candmclub folks come on aboard the #wcuponwheels @Gampa_cricket
Time for some cricket finally and here @Gampa_cricket and I share our thoughts on the Opening Battle of the #cwc19 https://t.co/xBTJnm5xN2 via @YouTube and also reveal who we‚Äôre backing in #ENGvSA #wcuponwheels
Our first full day on the road took us through a number of Shires before we finally touched down in Cheddar near Bristol and it included a very fortunate detour of the amazing Cheddar gorge https://t.co/yI5YGqhAih via @YouTube #wcuponwheels #CWC19 @Gampa_cricket
@cricketcouch @Gampa_cricket Haha good idea thala
