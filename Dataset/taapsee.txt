@JollyInCali @yamini_pb @juggernautbooks And this does seem like a tempting idea
@sumitkashyapjha Hahahhaa. I like the result 😂
Made a horrific mistake of watching the all the 6 episodes of “Big Little Liars” without waiting for the 7th one to arrive. Now this 6 days of wait is gonna test my patience 😫
@TheAtulMishra This time u r correct. By spending time on your moronic interpretation. So I think I should definitely stop now. Thanks for the hint
@sumitsaurabh Firstly thanks for calling me elite and intellectual but I wonder if I can really feel proud of that compliment coming from someone who doesn’t have a basic sense of the fact that yes when u mock at your own situation, it’s called satire and not statement. Thanks but no thanks
@rachitaprasadET @daftari I wish these same guys used their sensitivity over some Obnoxious statements made by some people in public. Maybe I would’ve taken them seriously then.
@TheAtulMishra Great to know you have a heart now try focusing on how to get some brain as well. Works better for the body when both are in tandem. Thanks
Statutory warning: people with no sense of sarcasm kindly ignore me n my tweet. Thank you , it was nice not knowing you 🙏🏼 https://t.co/OhIeOd6ZYf
