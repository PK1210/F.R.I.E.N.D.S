I am humbled and thankful to all 29 Members of Parliament from main political parties including 3 Union Ministers who attended an informal get-together on my invitation. They pledged to fight against child exploitation &amp; make a Child Friendly #India.
@smritiirani It is always a pleasure interacting with @smritiirani ji. We had a very fruitful discussion about making a Child Friendly India. I admire her futuristic vision on child protection.

I am very disappointed that the #AntiTraffickingBill was not even tabled and discussed in the Rajya Sabha. Our political class has once again failed the most vulerable children &amp; women. How long can the largest &amp; mature democracy ignore this brutal slavery? I will keep fighting.
Each time a child or a woman is raped, India is raped. Our politicians cannot wait for the next elections to be in power but our daughters have to wait a 100 years for justice. This is unacceptable. #NewIndia impossible without #RapeFreeIndia.
10 year old raped by sweeper inside school.

My humble appeal to leaders of all political parties, children are not only our future, they are our today.Let's do politics for next generation &amp; not next election. The growth &amp; development agenda of any nation can never be fulfilled without the inclusion of children #Budget2019
65 children rescued by @BBAIndia from Delhi finally saw the light of freedom. Today, if our children continue to toil in factories, working in place of unemployed adults, poverty will continue. Hoping for a positive growth in #budget2019 to let every child be free to be a child. https://t.co/VUunknXhHR
The vision of New India can only be realised if we make a child-friendly nation.

Today as the world observes International Day of Education, 262 million children aren‚Äôt in schools. 
Additional 40 billion Dollars are required annually to educate them. This is equivalent to just 7 days of global military expenditure. Think, what should be our priority? @UN
If our daughters cannot live freely, walk fearlessly, and talk openly at all times can we really call ourselves safe and civilized? Every day we should wake up to a safe India for children because they are all our children. #NationalGirlChildDay
