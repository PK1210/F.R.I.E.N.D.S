The greatest final in the history of World Cups.
RT @cricketworldcup: A World Cup final has just been tied off 50 overs, tied off the Super Over, and decided by superior boundary count.

L‚Ä¶
WHAT. A. MATCH.

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold #CWC19Final
New Zealand attempt two runs. Run out! England win the World Cup by superior boundary count.

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
3 from 2 required. The tables have turned. New Zealand face the same situation that ENgland did in their last over.

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
That's a MASSIVE six by @JimmyNeesh, followed by 2 more runs. 5 runs from 3 balls required!

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
New Zealand need 16 runs. Otherwise England will be the world champions.

@Martyguptill and @JimmyNeesh are the two players bestowed with the responsibility.

So many heroes, but only one will be celebrated.

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
Jos Buttler ends England's Super Over with a boundary. England put 15 on the board. Is that too much for New Zealand?

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
Ben Stokes almost pulled it off by himself. It's down to 4 of his teammates now. The Super Over beckons.

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold https://t.co/LZs98WYA65
ANOTHER RUN OUT! The two teams have ended their 50 overs on the same runs. For the first time ever, a World Cup final will be decided on a Super Over!

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
Ben Stokes attempts two runs and Adil Rashid is sacrificed in the process. 1 ball left. 2 runs to win. 1 wicket remaining. Lots of bitten nails out there today.

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
This is unbelievable! Ben Stokes takes 2 runs. The fielder throws the ball at the stumps, which hits the batsman and races to the boundary. 6 runs out of nowhere. 3 to win from 2!

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
2 dot balls and then a SIX! @benstokes38 is keeping the hopes alive in the dying moments of the match.

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
Neesham bowls Joffra Archer out! A brilliant slower ball that Archer completely misjudges. England have to score 15 runs off 6 balls, but with only 2 wickets in hand. THIS is what you call a final!

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
More drama! Trent Boult catches Ben Stokes, but touches the boundary line as he does so. 6 runs instead!

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
Aaaand Plunkett is gone! Trent Boult catches him in deep mid-on, off Neesham's ball.

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
Two overs to go. 24 runs required. This one's going down to the wire!

#ENGvsNZ #NZvENG #CWC19 #PlayBold
The New Zealand bowlers have brought their team back into the game in a strong way with those two quick wickets. Critical for England to build a partnership. #ENGvNZ #CWC19Final
Johnny Bairstow has scored 31 runs so far, of which 24 have just been off boundaries!
It's hard to imagine New Zealand gaining much headway today if they can't get Johnny out.

That moment when rain interferes with an India vs New Zealand match, YET AGAIN

#ViratKohli #INDvsNZ #CWC19 #SemiFinal1 #PlayBold https://t.co/QwAWwYueVy
Exactly what we didn't want to see!

Rains interrupt the match yet again in this tournament. NZ will get a respite and will look to come back and finish off strongly. As the things stand New Zealand are at 211/5 in 46.1 overs. 

Hopefully the rain break isn't long.
Bhuvi didn't have to wait for long to pick up his first! CdG departs nicking a slow delivery into the safe hands of MSD. CdG's gone for 16. 

üá≥üáø- 200/5 (44.4 overs)

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #SemiFinal1
Taylor survives! Gets the decision of LBW overturned through the review, off the first ball of this over. That would have been a big blow for New Zealand. 

#PlayBold #INDvNZ
NZ are accelerating now. Massive over for them as 18 runs come off Chahal's last over. 

üá≥üáø- 197/4 (44 overs)

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #SemiFinal1
6 off the first ball of Chahal's over and Taylor gets his 5‚É£0‚É£, but it took 73 deliveries to get there. He really was made to work hard for it. 

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #SemiFinal1
Hardik Pandya ends his quota of 10 overs giving away 55 runs. And he had picked up the wicket of Neesham. He has done his job well.

üá≥üáø- 179/4 (43 overs)

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #SemiFinal1
And now it's the battle between CdG &amp; Yuzi!
Neesham departs! Skies  a delivery off Hardik and is safely caught by DK. NZ losing yet another wicket. 

üá≥üáø- 162/4 (41 overs)

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #SemiFinal1
Just 10 overs to go and New Zealand have just managed to score 155. That wicket of Kane Williamson by @yuzi_chahal was crucial in pegging back the New Zealand's onslaught even before it took off. Will #TeamIndia be able to restrict the opposition to less than 250? 

#PlayBold
Aaand Kane WIlliamson is gone! Yuzi bowls a wicked one and Jadeja takes the catch!

#INDvsNZ #CWC19 #SemiFinal1 #playBold
Falls just short! Taylor survives as the ball just drops short of MSD. Bumrah already asking serious questions se he's back for his 2nd spell. 

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #CWC19
Another mistimed pull, and Taylor survives again as the ball lands in a no man's land. Brings up the 5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ partnership between Taylor and Williamson. 

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #CWC19
5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ for Williamson! Has brought calmness to the New Zealand innings. But need to get him out soon. 

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #CWC19
Boundary for Williamson. A 4‚É£ after 13 overs! India desperately needs to see the back of Williamson as he is very capable of scoring big, as he has proved already this tournament.

üá≥üáø- 99/2 (28 overs)

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #SemiFinal1
Taylor survives an LBW shout and immediately Williamson survives a run-out chance the next ball. It's all happening in this over! What an over this has been from @yuzi_chahal Wicket round the corner? 

üá≥üáø- 85/2 (26 overs)

#PlayBold #INDvNZ #SemiFinal1
Ravinder Jadeja strikes!! Nicholls gets his stumps rattled and is dismissed for 28. 

üá≥üáø- 69/2 (18.2 overs)

Persistence pays and Bumrah strikes!! Guptill buckles under the pressure applied by the no. 1 bowler in the world. Well taken catch in the slips by Captain Kohli!

First runs for New Zealand come in the 3rd over!

Make it 2! What a welcome for deSilva to the crease.

#PlayBold #INDvSL #CWC2019
What a way to bring up his 5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£! A smashing 6Ô∏è‚É£ over the offside. Ruthless.

Both the players have given us a flying start. 

üáÆüá≥- 39/0 (5 overs) 

#PlayBold #INDvSL #CWC19
King Kohli has had a good record against Sri Lanka. In his current form today might be a good opportunity to get that elusive ton. But with the way India are batting right now, they could reach the target much sooner.

#ViratKohli #TeamIndia #CWC19 #INDvsSL #PlayBold https://t.co/wlqfa2fY1N
Remember Ms. Charulata Ji from #TeamIndia's previous game? Captain @imVkohli had promised her tickets and she's at Leeds today to watch India play Sri Lanka! That special message from #KingKohli though! #Legend 

IC: @BCCI https://t.co/qJNUeisGCP
.@klrahul11 smashing boundaries quicker than anyone can type! Four no. 2Ô∏è‚É£ off the over! 

#PlayBold #INDvSL #CWC19
Crushed it through the offside!@klrahul11 is looking in ominous form, starts the over with a 4Ô∏è‚É£! 

#PlayBold #INDvSL #CWC19
"If @ImRo45 can play such exquisite shot, I can too!"- @klrahul11 
Boundary no. 2Ô∏è‚É£ off this over for  #TeamIndia 

#PlayBold #INDvSL #CWC19
Both the teams are back in the centre to begin the 2nd innings. Let's get this done!

#PlayBold #INDvSL #CWC19
After a rocky start, Sri Lanka steadied the ship to finish off with 264 runs. It's not a daunting total, but India have task ahead of them today.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold https://t.co/Y1mO4NrHVP
Agelo Mathhews' perseverance pays off and he has now scored a century üíØüëèüèΩ

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Sri Lanka scored 73 runs in the last 10 overs, and their run rate is now up to 5+

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Sri Lanka have recovered well after losing early wickets. 200 is up on the board now. What do India need to do to make a breakthrough here?

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Ravindra Jadeja finishes his last over unlike how he began his bowling today - conceding 11 runs, including a 6 and a 4.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Another quickfire stumping attempt by MSD, but this time it's unsuccessful. Angelo Mathews had his toe on the crease.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
FINALLY! Thirimanne is caught by Jadeja off Kuldeep Yadav's bowling. The partnership is broken, and the batsman heads to the pavilion after a neat half-century.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Given a new lease of life by the dropped catch, Angelo Mathews finishes off Jadeja's over with a six!

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Captain Kohli brings in Ravindra Jadeja to break the partnership, and he almost does it, were it not for a dropped catch.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
The runs have started to roll in for Sri Lanka. Thirimanne scores a boundary off Kuldeep to bring up his fifty.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
A clean, straight hook by Angelo Mathews to score a one-bounce boundary off Bhuvaneshwar Kumar. The Indian bowler is not having a good day.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
The last group match of the World Cup sees the team at the the top of the table defend its position against a team that has only pride left to play for. Can South Africa give India a boost and dent Australia's position on the table?

@cricketworldcup 
#AUSvsSA #CWC19 #PlayBold https://t.co/7tIdYWNEEx
Angelo Mathews gets a half century, as Sri Lanka start picking up the runs. It's been 90 runs since the last wicket fell.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Jasprit Bumrah has bowled just ONE no-ball in the entire tournament so far üòØ

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Bumrah is back in the attack! What devastation can he cause now?

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
After 7 overs, Ravindra Jadeja has conceded 19 runs, taken one wicket and is yet to concede a boundary üòØ

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
"Nobody goes through overs as quickly as Ravindra Jadeja does"
- commentator on Sir Jaddu's bowling.

He's kept it neat and tidy today.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
It's been a relaxed game for #TeamIndia so far. Early wickets and a restricted run rate have meant India are in full control.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold https://t.co/L6oCXuWO88
New bowler out to attack. Kuldeep Yadav is the man at the bowling end now.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
One of cricket's eternal rivalries will be renewed today, but the opponents could not be in more starkly different circumstances. Will it be a straight forward win for Australia

@cricketworldcup 
#AUSvsSA #CWC19 #PlayBold https://t.co/hkf1OwAXRt
So close! Captain Kohhli almost gets Thirimanne run out. The batsman dived full length to stay safe.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
MS Dhoni - the gift that keeps on giving. A short delivery by Pandya that Fernando simply guided into MSD's gloves. That's an important wicket for #TeamIndia

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
"Nice bowling Jad!" You can hear MSD's encouraging chants, as Jadeja completes a successful first over.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Jadeja strikes! And India have MS Dhoni to thank again! Mendis stumped by MSD like a flash of lightning ‚ö°Ô∏è

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
And now @imjadeja takes a crack at it!

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
A change of bowling as Hardik Pandya comes in to try something different for India.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Just one run conceded in that over. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar was practically unplayable, using that swing to perfection.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
üòØ That is some dangerous swing on the ball, executed by Bhuvaneshwar Kumar. A wave of change, perhaps?

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Two consecutive boundaries by Fernando got Bumrah to bowl a tight one on that last ball of the over.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
WICKET! Another unplayable ball by Bumrah and Perera is dispatched to the dressing room. Dhoni gets the catch again.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
In 8 World Cup matches played, Jasprit Bumrah has had an economy of 4 and a half runs per over.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Jasprit Bumrah finally concedes some runs - a boundary. How relieved did that make Fernando feel?

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Almost another wicket for @Jaspritbumrah93
Avishka Fernando saved by the review, after the umpire had initially raised his finger

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
In 5 overs played, Sri Lanka have put up 28 runs on the board - all of them off Bhuvaneshwar Kumar's bowling.

Bumrah is back to balance that out.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Will India come to rue that dropped catch? Perera rolls off another shot to the boundary. Not a good day so far for Bhuvaneshwar Kumar.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Confusion and a dropped catch, as Kuldeep and Pandya clash into each other to let Perera go scot free.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Bumrah gets the first blood! Karunaratne is dismissed just as he was starting to warm up to the Indian bowling!

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
Karunaratne picks up 2 boundaries and a single off Bhuvaneshwar Kumar's bowling, and is back in strike to face Bumrah.

#INDvsSL #CWC19 #PlayBold
