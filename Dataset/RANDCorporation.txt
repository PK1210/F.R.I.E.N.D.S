Students who face unique challenges (e.g., learning disabilities, poverty) may be especially reliant on teachers and schools for their development. Do educators have adequate support to help these students succeed?

We examined how an adult child's unemployment affects parents' financial assistance to that child, as well as the parents' household food consumption, income, and savings.

Here's what we learned: https://t.co/rq08PYUA7a
Despite our research showing the economic benefits of a two-state solution, this isn't where things seem to be heading. Now, we're looking at the implications of one-state solutions, confederations, annexation alternatives, and maintaining the status quo. https://t.co/jFfjHOrkhe
Do teachers have the support they need to help students facing unique circumstances, such as learning disabilities, housing instability, or poverty?

New study: Parents are more likely to give cash to an adult child once the child loses their job. Also, parents spend less money on food once an adult child becomes unemployed; they maintain this drop in consumption for a two-year period. https://t.co/rq08PYUA7a
We asked a nationally representative sample of teachers to rate the sufficiency of their access to supports for helping students with unique learning profiles.

Research suggests that location-based mobile apps like Pok√©mon Go can be beneficial to outdoor fitness. But very few augmented reality apps are geared toward children under age 9.

Following protests in #HongKong, it's difficult to predict where things will go from here, says @DerekJGrossman. 

But one thing is certain: failure of ‚Äúone country, two systems‚Äù is not an option for Beijing. https://t.co/swr4TXqAai
Augmented reality games bring creatures like dinosaurs, zombies, and ghosts into the real-world outdoors. Could this get kids outside and playing more?

It is imperative that teachers have access to a range of on-the-job supports that better enable them to educate and empower students with unique learning profiles.

How will Russian capabilities continue to develop over the next 20 years? And what will this mean for U.S.-Russian competition and for the U.S. Army?

RAND experts, working with #Pittsburgh to anticipate 21st-century challenges, put social inequality near the top of the list.

What the city needed was a way to not just identify disparities, but to show where it was making progress, and where it was not. https://t.co/q9E5D1E6AH
"Any successful economic development for the Palestinians is entirely predicated upon a stable, mutually agreed solution to the conflict with Israel on land, resources, and sovereignty. It will also demand strong support from the international community." https://t.co/jFfjHOrkhe
When an autonomous vehicle gets hacked, who gets sued? Our new research explores via four scenarios:

a ransomware attack
a hacked vehicle damaging gov't property
hacks on a connected roadway that cause damage
theft of information through hacking of AVs

Could the same kinds of online games and apps that keep kids inside in front of their screens be used to get them *outside* and more active?

A number of augmented reality app developers believe it can be done, and @DrDebCohen says it's worth considering: https://t.co/wRKe62NNwF
When it comes to helping students who face unique circumstances (e.g., learning disabilities, poverty), most teachers say that they have good support ‚Äî except in the areas of training and preparation time.

#Pittsburgh partnered with RAND to develop indicators of inequity.

Taken together, these provide a proof-of-concept for other cities ‚Äî that it's possible to track disparities across many fields in a way that is transparent and can help guide good policy. https://t.co/q9E5D1E6AH

A new RAND study examines what happens when parents decide to help out their unemployed adult children financially: https://t.co/rq08PYUA7a
What is media literacy? Can media literacy education help defend against the spread of misinformation and disinformation? What media literacy resources are publicly available?

RAND experts tackle these questions in a new #TruthDecay report: https://t.co/ENW7UvqxR6
Students in districts with carefully selected, prepared, and supported principals outperformed their peers by six percentage points on reading tests and nearly three points in math. Those are hard needles to move at the level of an entire district. https://t.co/n2YvxXIh1j
