30 runs too short according to me!
#NewZealand ate up too many dot balls.
#England bowlers were too good and have restricted them to a total they will be sure of chasing with the batting line-up they possess.

Playing with @sachin_rt right from childhood gave me a chance to watch countless innings of his. 2 that stand out for me are:

1) vs @BLACKCAPS at Auckland in 1994 when he scored a blazing 82 of 49 balls as an opener for the 1st time in ODIs.

A very mature knock played by @RishabPant777 today. He kept his cool and batted till the very end. Some great batting by @SDhawan25 and @PrithviShaw which gave @DelhiCapitals a quick start. #RRvDC https://t.co/iDGTOiMWCf
Well Played @ajinkyarahane88 outstanding inning. Keep it up #DCvRR
I missed the series due to an injury and watched @sachin_rt's innings on TV. Still remember calling him straight after he reached the hotel room that night. This innings of his was a Desert Rose for me.

What a great finisher MSD is! Took the match till the very end when @chennaiipl was almost down and out. But when @msdhoni is at the crease anything is possible. He will be the difference for India at the @cricketworldcup.

The display of strength from @KieronPollard55 last night was something else. All of his 10 Sixes were powerful.
Don't have words to describe the innings he played last night against @lionsdenkxip

There is less than a week to go for the @cricketworldcup squad to be announced for #TeamIndia. 
For me @cheteshwar1 should be the one anchoring the Number 4 spot.
The middle order needs solidity and we need someone to encounter swing and play a sheet anchor's role.

What an amazing partnership between @jbairstow21 &amp; @davidwarner31. Everyone who is playing in the @IPL  should learn a lesson from these two. It is not only about hitting 4s and 6s but also about running between the wickets.

He is a fabulous asset for any captain and his dedication towards the game is an example for all the youngsters playing the game today.
