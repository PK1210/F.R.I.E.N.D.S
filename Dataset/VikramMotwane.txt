@chink_ster Very 🙈
Amitabh, Govinda are notable male exceptions, though AB became a star in the 70’s, and Govinda’s real name is Govind. 
Saif is another exception. 
More exceptions in the women - Kajol, Rani, Preity, Tabu, Rekha, Juhi.
Deepika, Priyanka, Anushka, Kareena, Katrina, Kangana, Madhuri, Srivedi, Manisha, Meenakshi, Aishwarya, Raveena, Sonakshi, Alia.
Aamir, Salman, Shahrukh, Sanjay, Ranbir, Ranveer, Anil, Jackie, Sunny, Akshay, Ajay, Hrithik, Varun, Shahid, Irrfan.
So here’s an observation Bollywood Twitter - since the 80’s, to be a male (super)star in India, your name must have 2 syllables. And 3 if you’re female. Discuss?

@FilmCompanion @suchin545 It also doesn’t help that there are very few directors who truly love doing action films or sequences.
@FilmCompanion @suchin545 Our DPs and Sound people and Prod Designers and Editors and VFX people are amazing. But our Action and Special FX (rain, explosions, fire, gun shots) sucks.
@FilmCompanion @suchin545 And they’re not cheap. Most of the time it works out cheaper to hire an action director from abroad and pay for their stay rather than hire an Indian ‘master-ji’ and their ‘union-sanctioned’ team of pot-bellied assistants that haven’t seen any action movies since the 90’s.
@FilmCompanion @suchin545 It takes 6 of their team to do the job that one action director from abroad can do as efficiently, and mostly better.
@FilmCompanion @suchin545 Because Indian action directors are still living in the era of the Matrix. They’re slow to adapt, unwilling to learn, and in their own little bubble. They don’t have fresh ideas and they don’t encourage fresh young ideas or talent because they’re insecure about their jobs.
