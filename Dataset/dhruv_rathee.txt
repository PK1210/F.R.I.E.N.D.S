@hemirdesai Nice try but your justification fails -

- Cost of Statue is after donated Iron is accounted
- No guarantee on recovering money, depends on success / failure of bullet train 
- Bank Fraud number is given by RBI
- Demonetization loss is proven by GDP Data
Which of these is a bigger waste of public money? 🤔

₹3600 crores - One Statue

₹1,10,000 crores - One Bullet Train

₹74,000 crores - One yr of Bank Frauds

₹1,00,000+ crores - Demonetization

₹60,000 crores - Spending on 1 Election
Every third person in India had become a Chowkidar

But all Chowkidars were too busy abusing people online, perhaps that's why Bank Fraud has broken new records!

So Congress will get the highest vote share in the Chandigarh seat but somehow BJP will get that seat

What kind of prediction is this, Times Now? 😂😂 https://t.co/gdlmh6slgJ
No matter the reality, if a person constantly hears the same lie 10 times a day from different places, he’ll believe it’s the truth

Even Hitler enjoyed a comfortable support of up to 33% Germans in their last fair elections
I won’t be surprised if #ExitPolls are correct 

People underestimate the impact of Propaganda. Having 90% media in your control, Bollywood films, TV serials, social media ads all projecting you as a messiah and EC giving you a free hand to play dirty = Massive influence.

The Mandarin from Iron Man 3

Carefully crafted persona using heavy PR machinery and loads of money. A good actor, disguising his true idiotic self behind the meticulous photos, pre-written speeches and scripted interviews

He is speechless when caught without a script https://t.co/20k4aUe1YZ

First ever Press Conference of Modi  

Aaaaaaaannnnd this was also a #JUMLA! 

Look at Modi’s face, this is how every Indian feels after seeing his so called “press conference” https://t.co/051sEaJF89
@maanuraajan1 Thanks for proving my statement

Now tell the cowards in your party to openly support Godse instead of finding excuses to hide. Garv we kaho hum Godse Bhakt hai - tell this to Modi also.
Almost all people praising Godse on Twitter have the prefix of Chowkidar on them 

3 BJP leaders have already openly said it. 

But still Modi &amp; Amit Shah are afraid to openly admit this because it seems like they fear losing on a whole lot of votes from moderate people.
Sure, Kasab killed many in 26/11 but he didn't hit and run. 

He faced trial with heroic courage &amp; left a very powerful testament as to why he killed. I condemn the killing but I admire his courage blah blah..

You can justify anything and everything if you use #BhaktLogic

RT @dhruv_rathee: @ANI The Bomb Blast and Terror Accused lady supports a Terrorist like Godse and hates a Martyr like Hemant Karkare

Nothi…
Hahahahahaha

This proves that Modi only bought up this issue of Bofors and Rajiv Gandhi to do nautanki before elections.

Even CBI doesn’t find Bofors case worth investigating! https://t.co/7oguB99nDq
@ANI The Bomb Blast and Terror Accused lady supports a Terrorist like Godse and hates a Martyr like Hemant Karkare

Nothing new, shame is on people who voted for her.
@ANI I personally liked to call him Fanta Baba, but yeh Fanta drink ka apman hai. So I rarely use it anymore

This video clearly shows BJP guys stonepelting, vandalizing, throwing bottles during Amit Shah's rally in West Bengal. A Bengali icon statue was also destroyed. 

Is there any doubt who is behind the riot like situation?

It looks like #BharatJalaoParty at work again https://t.co/ByFv2syuQj

Who is Ajay Devgn trying to fool? 

What he does is called surrogate advertising - banned products like tobacco, alcohol are promoted in the disguise of another product.

If he cares about people, he should stop these elaichi ads!

9️⃣👉 Obama talks with me doing Tu-Tadak even though he doesn't speak Hindi
7️⃣👉 My mother gives me ₹1.25 every time she meets me nowadays, even though 25 paisa doesn't exist anymore

8️⃣👉 I was very Poor Fakeer even though I could buy digital cameras, touch screens, use e-mails all before they existed.
5️⃣👉 I first used a touch screen in 1990s, even before touch screens were invented

6️⃣👉 I advised military experts to use clouds to hide from Pakistani radar during Air Strike even though it makes no sense
3️⃣👉 Look at my handwriting.. it's so bad that it's printed text

4️⃣👉 I washed my own clothes till I became Gujarat Chief Minister, but my washerman from 1970s was very famous
Compiled List of #Fekugiri till now only from last two interviews of our Supreme Leader -

1️⃣👉 I had a digital camera in 1987-88 even before digital cameras existed 

2️⃣👉 I sent a color photo through email in 1988 even before the internet came to India
Not only are Modi's Interviews seemingly scripted, but it turns out that even casual questions are scripted line by line!

And on top of that, he lies so openly, so ridiculously that one can't help laughing over it. 

Modi seriously reminds me of the Mandarin from Iron Man 3 https://t.co/SgC4emqxWC
