Anybody who joined Rivigo, had to go through a truck driver training irrespective of the function they were joining. The 1st 1000 odd drivers were interviewed by Deepak and me.

Often truck drivers did not return home. Rivigo actually integrated truck drivers back into their families. Entrepreneurship entails empathy and we could empathise with truck drivers.
