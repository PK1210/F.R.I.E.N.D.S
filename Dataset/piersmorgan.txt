ü§£ü§£ü§£ Hi ladies, if you‚Äôre going to order me to stop seeking attention, being mean &amp; spewing antagonistic click-bait, probably best not to give me attention, be mean &amp; spew antagonist click-bait. FYI. https://t.co/3uCIlLBJ4B
Mrs May achieved nothing but failure to deliver Brexit. Not sure how much ‚Äòpride‚Äô can be derived from such a dreadful legacy. https://t.co/sx5XOGeB21
Why the hell is this disgusting paedophile being released so soon? A grotesque insult to all her many young victims. https://t.co/vis9x1BrQA
Did you buy 2nd rights to Life Stories? https://t.co/08oS0gnLKq
Top player, great guy, terrible taste in football teams (well, one of them anyway). 
Well played Crouchy - you've been a credit to the game. https://t.co/2gW17L5Qu8
Happy Birthday bro ‚Å¶@JeremyPM66‚Å©! https://t.co/lw0LdLBjXa
Excellent column. 
I suggest anyone wishing to be the next U.K. Ambassador to US reads it &amp; acts on it. https://t.co/P1kdD17PSo
Maybe you should shut the f*ck up, you heartless little pr*ck. https://t.co/GpqmIIeJKs
Just a fact. I had my DNA expertly analysed for @GMB. 
Revealed I am 91% Irish/Scottish/Welsh, 6.5% Eastern European, 1.6% West Asian, 0.9% Middle Eastern - and 0% English. https://t.co/uYuRo0UulK
So why are we paying for Meghan &amp; Harry‚Äôs ¬£2.4m refurb? https://t.co/juT6Ay7DvL
I‚Äôll be there.. and I fully expect Sir Roderick @rodstewart to dedicate ‚ÄòDa ya think I‚Äôm sexy‚Äô to me... https://t.co/TYcVe5JkLF
Yes, I was born in England &amp; support England at sport, but I have zero English DNA &amp; am Irish by blood &amp; birthright. https://t.co/WmzjE3yB22
I don‚Äôt mind your weirdly intense obsession with me ‚Å¶@caitlinmoran‚Å©, but I do mind you misquoting me. I‚Äôve never said a word about Meghan Markle‚Äôs jeans at Wimbledon. https://t.co/rb4em7cajH
An Irishman (and I speak as one...) who wants to captain England should sing the anthem. 
As @Eoin16, his credit, eventually acknowledged. https://t.co/4b3aseAs5L
Been a rocky journey as captain for @Eoin16. I didn‚Äôt like him not singing the anthem (he now does) &amp; he shouldn‚Äôt have bottled the Bangladesh tour. 
But he‚Äôs become an absolutely brilliant leader on &amp; off the pitch and deserves to lift that trophy on Sunday. https://t.co/376WTW3udf
How can we even be debating whether @JasonRoy20 should play in the Ashes? Of course he should. 
We should pick our most aggressive team. 
This would be my XI for 1st Test:
Roy
Bairstow
Root
Stokes 
Buttler 
Curran (S) 
Woakes
Rashid 
Archer 
Anderson 
Broad
Absolutely heart-breaking. 
My deepest condolences to Ben &amp; all his family.  RIP Iris. https://t.co/ikwY6DfNgd
Morning ‚ÄòCaptain‚Äô ‚Å¶@6_LKOSCIELNY‚Å© - kindly **** off from our club &amp; never darken our doors again. Thanks. https://t.co/md52rJ98Sl

Nonsense. If diplomats want to make scathing reports about their host countries then they shouldn‚Äôt commit them to electronic communication. Have you guys learned nothing from Wikileaks? https://t.co/A3rXLjnR4M
@KristinaSorge Congrats Sorge.. nobody has ever agreed with me about anything that much.
