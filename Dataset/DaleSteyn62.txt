White ball cricket has been good to me these past 12 months 🏏 🏆 https://t.co/bVt9zJQlUo
@AvinashB10 @ESPNcricinfo Third umpire. Not the standing umpire.
We’ve seen them miss important no balls, wides etc, very easily rectified by the tv umpire
@jamoamo @ESPNcricinfo There’s no obsession with warnings. However as a bowler if I creep on the line the umpire will warn me I’m getting close, next ball I overstep he calls no ball. If a batter starts to creep then ump can say chill you’re pushing it, if they don’t listen bang 5 penalty or mankad.
So here’s a mankad suggestion. 🏏 
Why not get the 3rd umpire to check the front foot for no balls, if he/she notices a batter leaving their ground prior to delivery he/she can then issue either a warning, or 5 penalty runs. If the batter continues, mankad comes in no worries.
He ain’t winning any spirit of cricket awards is old ashwin

Nothing against umpires, but I don’t understand how a LBW can be both out and not out depending on his decision...?

Oh, Sorry for the spelling mishap, Virat 😉
NZ often come up with noticeably different game plans. The buy in from bowlers and team seems to always result in good reward however strange the plan is. 
Interested to see how this round the wicket plan to Kholi goes, don’t recall anyone trying that before.

Just saw the “no ball” incident in the game WI vs Bangladesh.

Surely it’s time the 3rd umpire sitting with all the tv technology, can he/she not monitor the front foot, bouncer height etc and leave the on field umps to just make decisions at the batters end?
