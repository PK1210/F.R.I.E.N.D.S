@AirCanada Updates shoudl be sent when @AirCanada knows about the delay which was at least two hours before schedule flight as plane had not left EWR. Now that it is really delayed we receive plenty of updates
@AirCanada Flight AC7744 where @AirCanada can’t even inform@it’s customers the flight will be late so customers make other plans. First announcement came 1 min before scheduled departure.
How can @AirCanada run a business with flights delayed or cancelled 64% of the time! Such disrespect for customers paying hundreds of dollars to waste their time https://t.co/TwXN3duy82
How it looks to fly with @AirCanada these days to NY. Always late! They don’t inform customers their planes are late so we can’t make other plans or transfer flights so we are stuck in airports! Disrespectful, unprofessional; that is not how you stay in business. https://t.co/w0kqhqKk8y
