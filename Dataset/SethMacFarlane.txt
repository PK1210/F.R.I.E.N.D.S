Thanks for listening to a loudmouth. Go see #TheOrville at Comic-Con Saturday!!!
Because, remember, we‚Äôre not just seeing a trend here at home. We‚Äôre seeing the same thing all around the world. Social media as a platform for unedited, unvetted information dispersal free from an obligation to truth has helped propel other Trumps to victory around the globe. https://t.co/OQr6kU0pnP
I see BIG differences between Donald Trump and Barack Obama. The rise of social media and the spread of misinformation, in my view, has played a colossal role in the ‚Äúevolution‚Äù of political discourse. I see big differences in the politics of the last 4 years vs. the last 40. https://t.co/OQr6kU0pnP
I understand that feeling. When Obama‚Äôs justice department failed to hold accountable the Bush-era officials who participated in torture, I remember vehemently opposing the ‚Äúmove on‚Äù philosophy. It set a bad precedent, and precedent is important. It‚Äôs all wearily complex. https://t.co/B2ADVQjo3G
I agree. We do everything within our power to battle it. Right now, our power is limited. We don‚Äôt have the White House, the Senate, or the Supreme Court. Not enough of us voted in every election when it counted. Fine, we learned that lesson. Now, we need a reliable strategy. https://t.co/8mlqtoaZcr
Please read Brooking and Singer‚Äôs wonderful book ‚ÄúLikeWar.‚Äù It‚Äôs a terrific reality check that this platform needs. Social media helped propel Trump to victory in 2016. The solution to alcoholism isn‚Äôt more alcohol. Unless it‚Äôs just one, I guess. https://t.co/c7SywL9juq
Trump has made 90 billion prior comments just like this. There‚Äôs no surprise here. We know who he is. That‚Äôs why 2020 is crucial. That won‚Äôt happen if the party is divided like it was in 2016. If it‚Äôs Harris, I‚Äôll vote. If it‚Äôs Biden, I‚Äôll vote. Pete, Bernie, Warren, I‚Äôll vote. https://t.co/3PImSt7kuA
I like your version better. Sadly, the public has never reacted that way to dense political material (and an impeachment proceeding would be packed with it). Moderate viewers would be invested for about a week, go back to The Bachelor, then blame Democrats for dragging it out. https://t.co/M86B5EVk48
Exactly. For the record, I think a Green New Deal is not only a good idea, but essential for survival of our species. But I also don‚Äôt want to see it fizzle due to inexperienced legislative execution. There has to be unification. But the comment below? This is what Trump wants. https://t.co/YduKH4P9DZ
We agree. That‚Äôs been my point. Democrats are all on the same side. Everyone wants him out due to this kind of incident, and an infinity of others. The difference of opinion is over procedure. Work with each other to unify on a solution, but save the finger pointing for him. https://t.co/wV1thZK0Mw
We have seen all this before. He‚Äôs using the oldest trick in the book. He sees unrest among Democrats, so he‚Äôs stirring the pot and throwing gas on the fire below. It‚Äôs purely in the interest of igniting chaos. All too often, we fall for it. Let‚Äôs see the bully for what he is. https://t.co/BVQJpj7MJk
Did we mention #TheOrville is coming to Comic-Con? You‚Äôll see what we mean.
Get ready! https://t.co/oObWZVmLoL
Repeated studies show that, statistically, social media (where both Left and Right get most of their news) spreads more misinformation, conspiracies, and falsehoods than actual news. The editorial/fact-checking process of traditional newspapers/media has never been more precious.

Unlikely, as the voting public is clearly tired of Trump‚Äôs erratic, extreme behavior. Even interest in his tweets has fallen off.

It really all depends on what your endgame is. I want us to focus squarely on winning in 2020. To put out the fire before redecorating the home. I understand that other progressives have other priorities. And I make that statement without sarcasm, truly. https://t.co/8DwjPQdo0k
This GOP has shown us with crystal clarity who they are and where their loyalties lie. It would fail. They would then effectively accuse Democrats of wasting time and resources, and throngs of moderate voters would hand Trump a second term. Eyes on the ball: Vote him out. https://t.co/kb3H1w5xIw
1) An impeachment attempt begins. We all jump for joy. Trump is ecstatic. 2) Impeachment fails. 3) Trump shouts ‚ÄúI have been exonerated!‚Äù 4) A weary, substantial number of essential voters resent the Democratic Party for wasting time and energy. 5) Trump is re-elected in 2020. https://t.co/MUCUKsEztt
Whether you like Pelosi or not, a 92% rating from the ACLU with regard to her voting record would seem to indicate that it‚Äôs more textured than that. The larger issue is the ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not with us, you‚Äôre against us‚Äù methodology that seeks to silence all strategic discussion. https://t.co/6gap4nmAtn

Last I‚Äôll say bout the issue: I truly contend that the inclusion of a whooping studio audience at the debates is not only distracting, but in fact damaging and counterproductive to the political process. Town halls aside, it‚Äôs time to pressure the powers-that-be over this.
After two debates, @PeteButtigieg stands out to me as the most substantive candidate, however I was impressed by Harris‚Äô political stage presence. Have to say that either outcome would be positive. Great job to all the contenders though, and one more fuck you to the audience. https://t.co/S27rviLUKF

@PeteButtigieg Best answer to that question, and hey, funniest too.
Compare everything you‚Äôre hearing tonight - ideas, proposals, grasp of the issues, cohesive communication -  with what we hear every day from the sitting president. Submitted without comment.
More impressive candidates last night than tonight, but Buttigieg and Harris delivered in very different ways. My fear is that intellectual laziness will cause people to gravitate toward Biden alone as the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù choice. You‚Äôve met them all. Now do your homework.

@PeteButtigieg An extremely tough question about a critical issue - response was honest and without theatrics. Not something that can be answered in 60 seconds. Could devote the whole debate to it and still not scratch the surface.
@PeteButtigieg And a great call on religion. This guy is indeed having a very good night.
@PeteButtigieg only one who reminds us  that every developed country has both universal care and private insurance
@PeteButtigieg is the most impressive candidate on this stage so far. No chest-thumping, no pandering to the crowd, no reaching for the applause button, just substance and intellect. When you slice through the theatrics of the room, this is the guy who stands out.
@DNC I beg you in the name of all that is holy... lose the studio audience. They‚Äôre grating, they‚Äôre distracting, and they need to go. We want to hear from the candidates without grinding to a screeching halt twice a minute. Please, PLEASE make this change going forward.
Hey debate audience - If you applaud and cheer and go ‚Äúwooo‚Äù after every answer every time, it kinda... kinda diminishes the significance, doesn‚Äôt it?  Yeah. Yeah it does.
NBC, DNC, I truly have no idea who makes the call - but we folks at home don‚Äôt care what the studio audience thinks. Lose ‚Äòem. We want to hear from the candidates.
I truly wish they would get rid of the damn audience at these debates. If you add up all the seconds during which we grind to a halt so the crowd can applaud, it‚Äôs a significant amount of precious time during which we could be hearing substantive dialogue from the candidates.
