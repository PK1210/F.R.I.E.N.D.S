@anettebonc @_Amanda_J_Lee_ Thanks @anettebonc glad you found it useful üòä
@rwh3 @AlanKirkland @_Amanda_J_Lee_ Yes, definitely one way. In the paper we say: "it is important to note that interest groups may be meeting with the ministerial advisers regarding these issues, and there is no requirement to document such interactions."
@Matt_Hopcraft @_Amanda_J_Lee_ The Dental Assoc/council met with NSW health minister 4 times, the QLD ALP Minister twice and QLD LNP Minister 3 times. Three private dental firms met with the QLD LNP Health Minister. Dental schools met 2x with LNP QLD.
