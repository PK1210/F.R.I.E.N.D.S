The ideal video length on Twitter is 15 seconds or less ⏱

Check out these examples from brands keeping it short, sweet, and effective 🎥👇
@SproutSocial A6: One example is last year's holiday content. We wanted a feeling of warmth and human-ness and made GIFs to add richness to that sentiment. We shot this in a conference room, using a green screen. #SproutChat https://t.co/VYQeCU7pQz
@SproutSocial A5: We empower our team by being a "yes" team. We work on so many projects — there's no problem in letting some of them just be for fun, or just to test and learn. We welcome everyone’s creativity.  #SproutChat
@SproutSocial A4: The best way to get a response is to ask a question –– and the best questions are empathetic to what your reader is experiencing at that time. #SproutChat
@SproutSocial A3: Get inspired! Watching your competitors and the brands you admire for even just a lunch break can help identify content gaps your peers are leaving on the table as well as what best-in-class social looks like. #SproutChat
Join the #SproutChat, happening now! https://t.co/4V7ISLuLLW
@SproutSocial A2: Just as data gives us insights, so do replies and mentions. We leave room to try new things based on what our customers are telling us, and ultimately test and refine using, once again, data. We 💙 our data. #SproutChat
@SproutSocial @Twitter A1: Data removes some of the guesswork, saving you time and resources. You get immediate data on what type of content your audience may enjoy just by Tweeting. #SproutChat

Tell us: what brand(s) would you like to hear from on our podcast? 🎧📝
3. Make the copy short and sweet.

4. Stick to one CTA. 

5. Since you want people to click on your URL, consider removing the hashtags. If you really want to use them, limit to 1-2 that are specific and relevant to your content.
Here are some of our suggestions:

1. ALL CAPS (love this excitement but it can FEEL LIKE SHOUTING)

2. Instead of a text link, use a website card. This will clean up the Tweet and make it extra-clear where people should click. Here's how to make one: https://t.co/dLtzrAJpdX
