@womensday For 10 years, @globalrust scientists have worked to reduce the world's vulnerability to stem, yellow, and leaf rusts of wheat, a fungal disease that can wipe out whole harvests. The BGRI also engages and trains farmers to identify signs of rust and prepare for outbreaks. https://t.co/BUkhxa3xMD
