Cites collaboration between US and China, 10 military-military agreements, and says Chinese are more open to transparency than they were in 2008. Chinese ‚Äútrade, commerce, and investment‚Äîall are welcome.‚Äù
But Rood, who mentions that his mother is Chinese, turns hard to describe how US and China should create ‚Äúpeaceful competition.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur intentions are not to contain China.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe are not destined to be adversaries.‚Äù Admits US struggles to deliver that message to Chinese officials.
Says Xi acknowledged that there‚Äôs a security aspect to Belt and Road, and accuses China of ‚Äúpredatory lending‚Äù that leads to ‚Äúcountries turning over their sovereignty.‚Äù

Pentagon says the supply chain shift will prevent any delays in plane deliveries. Ellen Lord: "We've worked on alternate sources on the more than 900 parts...We are proceeding with a very orderly winddown through March 2020, so we expect minimal impact of the program."
The cost of this decision? Ellen Lord: "500-600 million dollars in non-recurring engineering in order to shift the supply chain."
But Deputy Under Secretary for Policy David Trachtenberg says Turkey remains partner: "Turkey has been member of NATO longer than I have been alive, well over 6 decades, and reliable, strategic partner. From departmental perspective...we expect to continue that relationship"
That from Undersecretary of Defense Ellen Lord just now. Says Turkey's removal will reduce Turkey's ability to help NATO defense: "Turkey's purchase of S400 is inconsistent with its commitments to NATO, will have detrimental impact on Turkish interoperability with the alliance."
US formally removes Turkey from F-35 program. "Turkey cannot field Russian intelligence collection platform [S-400] in proximity to where F35 program makes repairs, houses F35. Much of F35 strength lies in stealth. Ability to detect would jeopardize the security of F-35 program."

Our conversation with Hong Kong Legislative Councillor Michael Tien: https://t.co/h8gtFFc3JF
And it seems China will _not_ use this moment to fulfill unrealized promises of greater democracy under one country two systems. Instead, it may increase Hong Kong‚Äôs integration into the mainland. Note the connection to Belt and Road in this editorial: https://t.co/zMV8OOfQNG
He also described how Carrie Lam did not decide her own fate: Asked who does, he said, ‚ÄúIt is the Central People's Government.. And under the China system, you don't just quit like that.‚Äù
And today Michael Tien, pro-Beijing member of Legislative Council who‚Äôs been willing to criticize government over extradition bill, told us he understood protestors‚Äô anger over the bill and anxiety about Hong Kong‚Äôs independence. Although he would not accept all their demands.
An academic team who has been researching the protestors told us most demonstrators‚Äîeven those not at the Legislative Council last night‚Äîsupport the violence because they believe something dramatic had to happen. As one protestor told us last night: https://t.co/D4Rq8iW7iq
A few older pro-democracy advocates who criticized the violence believe it was conducted by plants to make the protestors look more violent than they actually were. But we found no evidence of that. We found some questioning of tactics, but overall support for what happened.
This is the scene right before all the protestors left the Chamber. By midnight‚Äîjust a few minutes before the police fired tear gas outside‚Äîonly journalists were left. https://t.co/tr7WjCx1Ji
Later, protestors occupied and ransacked Legislative Council. Ironically they remained disciplined. When holdouts wanted to make last stand, large group charged in, forcibly removed them. There are no official protest leaders, but once decision was made to leave, executed swiftly
But outside Legislative Council, not far away, we met a younger and angrier crowd. Many protestors tried to block us from filming, fearing surveillance and not realizing we were reporters. Ever after asking who we were, some demanded no cameras
Yesterday was a tale of two protests. Hundreds of thousands left Victoria Park and streamed through the city. Mood was optimistic, I met families willing to talk, and protestors moved patiently, inspired and protected from the sun by umbrellas: https://t.co/crqZns84Te

On whether murder was a "rogue operation," as the Saudis describe: "This crime can not qualify as a so-called rogue operation. I want to really insist upon the fact that this was a state killing."
On whether Saudis in the Consulate tried to convince Khashoggi to return to the Kingdom: "There were a couple of sentences related to him returning to Saudi Arabia, but not sufficient in my opinion to conclude that convincing him was a primary objective."
On premeditation: "There is very little doubt that murder was premeditated... What I could not ascertain was whether or not killing was the first objective or whether they were also considering kidnapping, with killing a second option in case kidnapping failed."

- Senior Administration official also says believe naval and bomber assets successfully deterred a larger attack.
More from today 
- Some D's demanding intel briefings, warning about war. @SenatorMenendez: "We cannot and will not be led into military adventures. The Administration must provide this critical information to Congress." 
- But R's @SenatorRisch @MacThornberry say did get briefed
-But senior Democratic congressional staff told me yesterday that Administration was "inflating the threat." And this is not someone who usually makes that accusation.

-US military moves not massive deployments, but send obvious message
-POTUS might have called NYT story about 120,000 troops "fake news," but US officials confirm 120k one of many possible contingency plans. 
-US officials insist intel threat stream is real, "deeply concerning"
-Iran analysts say Iran trying to prove it won't just accept US pressure. Also trying to provide release valve,a rally-around-the-flag moment for population
-U.S. official: Iran ratcheting up resistance but with plausible deniability, and stopping short of direct conflict with US
-US, Saudi officials believe Sunday tanker attacks were relatively sophisticated.
-US officials say they "believe" Iran or proxies behind attacks, but won't provide proof. So they either don't have any, or won't share it yet.
Our #Iran coverage from yesterday:
-Saudi officials say Houthi drone attack "game changer" b/c of precision, distance, successful targeting
-Former intel official w/ experience in Saudi says, take that w/ grain of salt. Houthis have done this. Saudi just doesn't usually publicize

.@Jeremy_Hunt warns Iran: "If they break that deal, then there will be consequences, in terms of how European powers react. We urge the Iranians to think very long and hard before they break that deal...We strongly urge them to reconsider them what they said in their letter."
But then @SecPompeo suggests a restrained US response. He calls Iran's letter to Europeans "intentionally ambiguous" and says, "We will have to wait to see what Iran's actions actually are... We'll see what they actually do. The United States will wait to observe that."
Asked about @HassanRouhani's announcement in London, @SecPompeo cites Churchill: "Not far from here are the Churchill War Rooms, where a leader of this great country stared evil in the face. And recognized a threat that evil presented to the entire world."

What @HassanRouhani announced this morning (1/3)
Iran will build up stockpile of uranium, heavy water. Under JCPOA, Iran reduced stockpile from 22,000 pounds of high-enriched uranium, capped it at 660 pounds of low-enriched uranium. If Iran crosses cap, would not be in compliance

.@APDiploWriter provides most succinct @SecPompeo quotation on why he went to Iraq:"We wanted to let them know about the increased threat stream...and give them a little bit more background...so they could ensure they were doing all they could to provide protection for our team."
And asked about Iran's expected announcement tomorrow it will stop adhering to parts of the JCPOA but not withdrawal entirely from the deal, says, "This is binary. You are either in compliance or you are not."
He went a little farther in his description of the intelligence that led to Sunday night's announcement about the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Group, describing it a threat by Iran to "to take American forces out that continue our campaign against ISIS."

But Pence also uses the warnings/sticks the US has been using all along: repeats "all options are on the table"; warns US could sanction all 25 Venezuelan Supreme Court justices; warns "safety of Juan Guaido and his family is of paramount importance to the US."
Combined, it's an attempt by the Trump Administration to highlight the carrots it has been using to try and convince the military to switch sides.
