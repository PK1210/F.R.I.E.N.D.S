There are two excellent biographies of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, by BR Nanda and Govind Talwalkar respectively. Gokhale was a truly remarkable man; he was admired by both Gandhi and Jinnah, who otherwise agreed on very little! https://t.co/Ynqe2r7KGA
In June 1914 Gokhale fell ill, and Mrs Besant wrote to him in worry: 
"For India's sake do not throw away the future for the present. Give your body a chance".
Gokhale died next February, at the tragically early age of forty-eight. https://t.co/acfthssdXY
Annie Besant, wishing Gopal Krishna Gokhale on his birthday in February 1914:

These quotes are from a fascinating book on the friendship between Tagore and the French/European writer Romain Rolland, edited by Chinmoy Guha (no relation of mine!):
https://t.co/fenPtgzmW9
Rabindranath Tagore, May 1922: "This movement fails to draw its inspiration from a large vision of humanity but, on the contrary, deliberately obscures it in the minds of the followers in order to intensify to a glowing red heat the consciousness of national individuality".
Rabindranath Tagore, May 1922: "There has been a great political upheaval in our country. It has roused the minds of the people, but by incessantly harping upon wrongs done to us and belittling cultures foreign to India has got mixed up with passions that are evil".

Quoting these remarks by Sastri, the scholar K. Swaminathan contrasts Gandhi with "Charismatic leaders, momentary meteors like Hitler, Mussolini and Khomeini, [who] gain followers and lead movements by making others feel weak, helpless and dependent on those towering tyrants".
V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, Gandhi’s friend, contemporary and critic, once remarked: “Gandhi does not want blind or timid followers; he wants clear-eyed, courageous fellow travellers. He does not want hero-worshippers; he wants fellow-worshippers of Truth with him”. (1/2)

Playwright, actor, institution-builder and patriot, Girish Karnad was a colossus. It was a privilege to have known him, a far greater privilege to have seen his plays and read his work. I wrote this tribute to him on his 80th birthday:

Hamid Dalwai, writing in the 1960s:  "Personally, I believe that no religion can provide the foundation for an ideal society. It follows that neither Islam nor Hinduism can be the basis of an ideal social order."
        True then, even truer now.

The bitter truth, as enunciated in May 2018: "Had a non-dynast been head of our principal Opposition party, the PM would have found it impossible to hide his own government’s failures in the present by repeatedly diverting attention to events &amp; personalities of the distant past".
As I wrote: "Since Nehru’s great-grandson is Congress president only because he is Nehru’s great-grandson, the PM shall talk repeatedly about alleged errors made by all his ancestors, hold his descendant responsible for them, and warn voters against trusting the nation to him."
I had warned that "repeatedly correcting the PM’s errors of fact and interpretation plays  into his hands; in part because the BJP has its own 'alternative facts', in part because it keeps the debate safely in the past."
As I predicted in May 2018: "Modi will continue to speak of matters from 20/40/60 years ago, making the Congress president responsible for the mistakes (real or  alleged) of his father, grandmother, &amp; great-grandfather, while preempting discussion of the PM’s own mistakes now".
I wrote in May 2018 that criticisms of the Modi government’s failures will be "answered by referring to Nehru’s failures in the 1962 war; ...by referring to Indira Gandhi’s Emergency in 1975;  ....by referring to Rajiv Gandhi’s overturning of the Shah Bano judgment in 1986...".
Exactly a year ago, I wrote in the @IndianExpress that  "so long as the PM has an excuse to attack the gross and irrefutable facts of Congress dynasticism, he will use it, to avoid a searching examination of his own record":
