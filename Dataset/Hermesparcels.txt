David is working towards a LGV Apprenticeship; drivers are in demand so this will benefit David and Hermes, he said "It gives me a chance to improve on maths and English as well as developing my skills so I feel this is perfect for me." 🚚📔 #NAW2019 #BlazeATrail #benefit https://t.co/jI2cfBO8fJ
@staceybedwell86 @RoyalMail So glad we could help you keep your vision! @staceybedwell86 🥳🙌
Hermes launched the Degree Apprenticeship scheme last year, Sean was one of the first to join, he said "I believe that having the opportunity to take part in a Level 6 IT apprenticeship is life changing." Since the launch, Hermes and Sean have learned a lot! 👍 #NAW2019 #learn https://t.co/UcoSHbtFSJ

@Hermesparcels…
Ben is one of our Degree Apprentices working in the Warrington Hub, whilst studying for his degree. 🎓 Ben chose his apprenticeship because he "wanted to get stuck into the working world." He's brought a new energy and approach to problem-solving! #NAW2019 #BlazeATrail #energise https://t.co/UJTC6dwb04
@LauraSpoonie Go Errol! Please DM us your postcode and we can pass your feedback (and suggestion) on to his manager! 🥳 https://t.co/B1hamPzZ6T
An appetite to learn is invaluable to employers and apprentices. Matthew is an Engineering Apprentice, he said "Apprenticeships enable you to start working and earn a decent wage while you learn key skills and gain qualifications of your trade." #NAW2019 #BlazeATrail #zest https://t.co/7g7i8MUv8q
