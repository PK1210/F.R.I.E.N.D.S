@WhiteBallStats @timwig (5)...genuinely predictive of future Lions selection, then that enables you to refine those scouting methods even further.
In summary, you’re right, but unfortunately it’s not that simple.
@WhiteBallStats @timwig (4)...players are a very small subset of the original cohort, and contain almost all future England players.  So although there is an unavoidable element of self-reinforcement about the logic.  If you can more accurately predict which elements of your data for 15yr olds is...
@WhiteBallStats @timwig (3)...are so rare.  They take a very long time and require a huge upfront effort for a very distant pay off.
That’s why most research ends up being done retrospectively.  But that is far, far cruder and less useful because it’s impossible to avoid survivor bias.

Future Lions...
@WhiteBallStats @timwig (2)...gone on to achieve success at that level.  If you start with 15yr olds that is a minimum of a 15-20yr wait.  (For example, since 1990 we have had 11 batsman who have debuted and gone on to avg 40+ in Tests).
That is why good examples of these types of longitudinal studies..
@WhiteBallStats @timwig Agree with that.  And in a perfect world we would do.  But time and sample size prohibit.

@edwardscricket @SuttonProfessor @englandcricket @cricketmonthly @Athersmike c)Also, the figures I used were a little high.  I have since learned that the reaction times that I quoted, which are for initiating an action, are higher than those for adjusting an action which is already underway, in response to the ball deviating, say. 9/
@edwardscricket @SuttonProfessor @englandcricket @cricketmonthly @Athersmike I’ve put a good schoolboy batsman on a high speed bowling machine next to a Test player and the difference is negligible.  Replace the bowling machine with a Test-class bowler, and the difference is a chasm.  The magic happens before the ball is in the air. 8/
@edwardscricket @SuttonProfessor @englandcricket @cricketmonthly @Athersmike b)In that piece I look only at the effect of things that the batsman can’t predict in advance, the deviation of the ball once it is in flight.  I agree entirely that most of the skill that makes our blokes special happens prior to ball release.  7/
@edwardscricket @SuttonProfessor @englandcricket @cricketmonthly @Athersmike a)I refer to reaction time rather than vision. Not my area, but I think the received wisdom is that our players need, and tend to have, better than average vision, but once they pass the necessary minimum there is no apparent performance edge in being better than that. 6/
@edwardscricket @SuttonProfessor @englandcricket @cricketmonthly @Athersmike They are my friends so I may be biased.
I would slightly disagree with some of your thoughts on my length article -  5/
@edwardscricket @SuttonProfessor @englandcricket @cricketmonthly @Athersmike So some things are happening automatically, but the conscious brain is clearly setting the parameters.  I feel that in that grey area we tend to overly ascribe blame/credit to the conscious/accountable part of the player rather than to the unconscious/impotent part. 4/
@edwardscricket @SuttonProfessor @englandcricket @cricketmonthly @Athersmike The other end of the same argument is that batsmen clearly have some conscious involvement in their shot selection.  A batsman in a defensive situation will play a completely different shot than he would if he was in an attacking situation and the same ball was bowled.3/
@edwardscricket @SuttonProfessor @englandcricket @cricketmonthly @Athersmike Mac’s point on p.218 is that he can consciously understand it backwards (retrospectively) but not forwards (in real-time), that things happen so fast he has to rely entirely on instinct and training to respond.  2/
@edwardscricket @SuttonProfessor @englandcricket @cricketmonthly @Athersmike Thanks John, I have always found this the most fascinating and least accessible aspect of the sport I am supposed to know something about.
