Taking the new year back to the (Nova) 90s.✨ pumasportstyle #ad https://t.co/bopgsWjkTj
@jameelajamil Thank you. I only went on twitter because a lot of people close to him were so hurt by what you said so I had to say something. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect that. Sending you love and best wishes in return. Just asking for some sensitivity at this time
@jameelajamil I am glad that we can have this open conversation without trying to attack each other, it’s just very raw for a lot of people, me included. I am going to step away. I am sending nothing but love and I hope you feel the same
@jameelajamil All I ask is that you consider those who are hurting right now and leave some space for that before discussing the issues that need to be. That’s all
@jameelajamil I agree but what you are saying you must understand is upsetting me greatly. I am grieving someone who was special to me. It’s very tough to have this conversation without getting emotional.
@jameelajamil You can not compare Harvey to Karl! Especially to me
@jameelajamil Please trust me, I am doing the best that I can my dear and all of these things NEED to be addressed. As we all know, annoyingly, change takes time. I wish it didn’t
@jameelajamil I agree with you but please don’t call him a bad human, that is simply not fair. We should be talking about the people alive, in power, ruling the world who are hurting, destroying far more lives than this man who has passed only yesterday.
@jameelajamil Honest yes and this should be a general dicussion which should be spoken about outside of just him. He is not the problem. The  way the world is... and the way the industry has been for a long time. It’s time for change and I agree with that
@jameelajamil It saddens me deeply that anyone was hurt, that I do not condone. It is not possible to go through life without hurting people. He was not a saint, he is a human being like all of us who made mistakes and we should all have the chance to be forgiven for that
@jameelajamil I understand what you were trying to do and I apologize if I offended you or anyone else. I just don’t feel that living in the past and bringing up things that have already happened helps anything. Let’s move forward and lead with love. That’s it...
All of these things should have been addressed while someone is living, not the day after someones death
Everyone has their own opinion and I felt the need to voice my own. All I want is for everyone to love each other no matter what. Just please understand that it’s an extremely emotional time and we must try use love instead of hate
The face you make when you are asked to be a judge on @rupaulsdragrace COMING SOON... https://t.co/3EISumP06h

I wish I had been able to tell you how much you meant to me. I love you @karllagerfeld all I can say is thank for the bottom of my heart 💔💔💔
I am so lucky and grateful to have had him in my life, worked with him and been able to spend time with him.... Although now, I wish it had been more. His legacy will live on forever. I miss you more than I could ever try and describe.
He is a visionary, a genius but more than that.... a dear friend. Outside of fashion, he was one of the most interesting and caring men I have ever met.
Every time I try and write about this man, all i do is cry. He changed my life, he believed in me when so many others didn’t including myself. He also introduced me to some of the most important and special people in my life.
