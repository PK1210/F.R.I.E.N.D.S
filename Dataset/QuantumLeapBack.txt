@enlightendworld @s_karkala @saliltripathi @waglenikhil Are you talking about Mr Modi here. “Lynched people for power”. Last we heard, it was done by bhakts all over India.
@faisalmustaqim3 You have perhaps looked at the total tax forgone instead of just the corporate tax forgone.
We can raise enough resources for universal public services if we stop these giveaways to the corporate sector! https://t.co/pAee130TnD
Loot of middle class incomes is the least of #AbHogaNYAY ‘s problems - more than what is required is given away as taxes forgone by the corporate sector- #NoMo2019 #abkibarsochkeyaar Vote for #लोकतंत्र and not #लूटतंत्र https://t.co/prPQ5wjj5M
There are many problems with the way #AbHogaNYAY seems to be designed - that middle class incomes will be looted is not true - the giveaways to corporate sector are enough to fund it - Vote for #लोकतन्त्र and not #लूटतंत्र #NoMo2019 https://t.co/aeRF5m4sJs

@neeraj222 @shashibk @BDUTT @sagarikaghose @nit_set @ArchisMohan @Nidhi @virsanghvi You have come late to the party. We have had this discussion on different posts. See our rebuttal on the post on write-offs.
@neeraj222 Please throw some light, Sir.
@nikhilpghag @Neel73 @BDUTT @sagarikaghose @nit_set @ArchisMohan @Nidhi @virsanghvi Who’s scared of what? Have you read all that we have presented here? Inequality has risen dramatically in the post 2000 phase and it has to do with the skewed nature of the growth process for which both Congress and BJP led policies are responsible. Here we are assessing PM Modi.
@neeraj222 @nikhilpghag @Neel73 @BDUTT @sagarikaghose @nit_set @ArchisMohan @Nidhi @virsanghvi Of course! Because you hold a PhD from Indian Statistical Institute, right?
@RasheshPatel @ThePrintIndia @TheQuint @thecaravanindia @AltNews @IYC @INCIndia Otherwise I may even claim that an Indian astronaut landed on the Mars under the supreme leadership of PM Modi for all you care! Will you believe that too just because it has his picture?
@RasheshPatel @ThePrintIndia @TheQuint @thecaravanindia @AltNews @IYC @INCIndia It’s not my responsibility to file an RTI. Whatever we are releasing is based on govt approved sources unlike the posters you have shared which has no source whatsoever! So, at the very least there should be a source to the data based on which claims are being made!Minimum ethics

@vandit25 @BDUTT @sagarikaghose @nit_set @ArchisMohan @Nidhi @virsanghvi Then we will give you another data to show that this govt has been as non-serious as the previous one in recovering the amounts in these fraud transactions. So, even if for argument sake we agree with you, it doesn’t say much about this Chowkidar! Wait for our coming releases.
@RasheshPatel @ThePrintIndia @TheQuint @thecaravanindia @AltNews @IYC @INCIndia Arey bhai, who asked them not to bring it back since they claimed they will bring black money!! Instead they inflicted a hare-brained demon of demonetisation, which achieved absolutely nothing.

@pcsinha15 Two things, Sir:
(a) this includes central universities and institutions (b) even if most were state universities, BJP can’t claim that some 80% of the state govts they are running and then when it comes to accountability, the responsibility disappears! This is illogical.
@vandit25 @BDUTT @sagarikaghose @nit_set @ArchisMohan @Nidhi @virsanghvi Where does the source say that all these were committed earlier and only reported now? Or do you mean something else? That these are not frauds as yet?
@vandit25 @_YogendraYadav @Mayawati @SitaramYechury @RahulGandhi @kanhaiyakumar @academicsagain1 @NOMOre_2014 @yadavakhilesh @jigneshmevani80 @pbhushan1 Ans 1. Enrolment is decided by UGC policies and education policy of the HRD. #ModiHaiToMumkinHai Ans 2. Private universities are normally more expensive and at times even unaffordable. Hence access is limited. In quite a few instances you even have seats based on donations.

@RasheshPatel Did you seriously say jobs? Even the govt is shying away from claiming it!!
@RasheshPatel Please read all our posts here. Don’t go by party propaganda! I can claim the moon for all you care :)
@RasheshPatel And so is acche din. The Congress (UPA2) has paid price for being one of the most corrupt governments. Just as one is critical of that govt so should one be of this one too. At least be objective in our assessment. I hope you agree.
@RasheshPatel Neither is the Congress दूध का धुला nor the BJP! So, the assessment will be made on their respective performances rather than saying 5 yrs is too little to judge. This is the second NDA govt by the way. So, it’s 10 yrs of assessment actually. Shining India of NDA 1 was a chimera.
@RasheshPatel So we can’t negate those achievements. All the IITs, IISc, ISIs, AIIMS and many more are products of that period. India became self reliant in food after being an importing country for decades. There’s no doubt that many challenges remained to be plugged.
@RasheshPatel Well there again we disagree! This whole 60 yr narrative is strange. There are many things that India achieved after it was left thoroughly exploited by the British when we gained independence. The solid foundations in terms of institutions were built in early post colonial phase
@RasheshPatel Finally we get to agree :)
@RasheshPatel You will be surprised to know that per college enrolment has come down. And seats don’t necessarily need to increase in institutions which are unaffordable to a large section of the population. Why not affordable institutions which are inclusive in character?
अधिकतम शासन की बात और ज़मीनी स्तर पर निजीकरण और बजट कटौती - यह कैसी राजनीति है मोदीजी!

@shashibk @BDUTT @sagarikaghose @nit_set @ArchisMohan @Nidhi @virsanghvi Well, we are not. Let’s say for argument sake that the previous govt also had a similar performance (less likely if you see year 2013-14, one yr prior to this govt), PM Modi has promised a decline in such frauds not a rise! The result is the opposite irrespective of previous govt

Replugging the data related to NPA-Banking here: A story of increasing frauds, corporate discounts and destruction of public sector banks! On the other hand, rural distress and joblessness continue. These are the real issues. #JantaMaafNahiKaregi for all of this! https://t.co/4iUN8A8iEL
we write off NPAs, we sell off NPAs with massive discounts - as a result public sector banks make losses despite operating profits - and then we all call for privatisation of banks as the solution! #WahModijiWah #ChowkidarNahinJawabdar #goodbyemodi #academicsagainstModi https://t.co/bFUmATijGO
@KiranTeotia @kavita_krishnan @PMOIndia @RahulGandhi I don’t understand what’s the hypocrisy or double standards here! We have said upfront that we will be using publicly available data to analyse this govt. The idea is to objectively look at the performance of this govt on its own data however limited it may be. Data speaks!
@KiranTeotia @kavita_krishnan @PMOIndia @RahulGandhi Would you accept international data agency’s data?
@Kamal1605 @_YogendraYadav @PMOIndia @RahulGandhi हम तो अध्यापक हैं। ना कोई मालिक है हमारा और न अपनी पूँजी!
@Umangnsingh @PMOIndia @RahulGandhi Absolutely! These facts come out of a programme we stumbled upon. Raises exactly the points you are making. You may find it interesting although the video is tad too long :). https://t.co/QvXitv73l8
@Umangnsingh @PMOIndia @RahulGandhi We totally agree with you on that. Lenders are to blame as much as the borrowers if not more. And the thing is most of these companies were getting loans even though the ICR&lt;1 long back. That was a red signal of some sort especially for projects with low gestational lags.
@anuragsinha007 @kavita_krishnan @PMOIndia @RahulGandhi Since you are claiming we don’t understand, please throw some light on where are we wrong. Genuine attempt to engage not a swipe.
@anuragsinha007 @kavita_krishnan @PMOIndia @RahulGandhi That’s just withdrawing from a discussion. Your choice. You challenged and then yourself withdrew. Unless you had nothing to say to begin with!
@KiranTeotia @kavita_krishnan @PMOIndia @RahulGandhi If only stock markets were the true indicators of the health of a bank/company! Please go and take a hard look at the profitability statistics of the banks. Data publicly available on RBI website. We can help if you find it difficult to locate.

@ravibagri काहे बौखला गए हैं? अभद्र भाषा तो इस्तेमाल ना करें चाहे असहमति ही क्यों ना हो! वैसे जो यहाँ लिखा है उसमें कोई opinion नहीं है, तथ्य है बस। तथ्य की कोई पॉलिटिक्स नहीं होती, क्यों सर?

NPAs have been sold off at huge discounts - and it is all very suspicious - single bidder, rule change at the last minute - corporate bonanza it is indeed - also quid pro quo?

@rishisharmabhu @kanhaiyakumar Open unemployment has always been low in developing countries in comparison to developed countries. Did you understand it the other way? Why? Please read our previous comment carefully.
@rishisharmabhu @kanhaiyakumar I am sure you are aware of the fiscal stimulus which included heavy injection on the NREGA during the global recession period. Just look at the GDP growth rate during that phase. It blips for a single year (2008-09) and goes back up because of that stimulus.
@rishisharmabhu @kanhaiyakumar And about your comparison with the US, there’s a huge difference between first and third world. In the former there’s social security of some sort, in the latter hardly any. So, open unemployment is generally low in third world countries.
@rishisharmabhu @kanhaiyakumar Check the dates of the global recession and the data here before making mundane assertions!
@rishisharmabhu @kanhaiyakumar And as for whether India was affected in 2008-09, it was less affected because of a countercyclical fiscal stimulus in India. If you want I can refer a few research articles to you regarding this.
@rishisharmabhu @kanhaiyakumar Do you even know which year the global economic recession happened? Recession hit in 2008-09 and the data here is for a year earlier 2007-08. So, please go and do some basic calendar check before advising others!
Our next reason (#11) is going to put this entire issue of better NPA recognition and resolution under Mr Modi to rest. Watch out! हमारा अगला कारण (# 11) बेहतर एनपीए मान्यता और संकल्प के इस पूरे मुद्दे की आख़री नकेल साबित होगा। देखते रहें!
@PMOIndia, इन दोनो चार्ट्स को कृपया देखिए। बायीं चार्ट ये दिखती है की सरकार ने बड़े पैमाने पे कॉर्प्रॉट क़र्ज़ा माफ़ी की है वहीं दायाँ चार्ट ये बताता है की बच्चों के पढ़ने और स्वास्थ के लिए सरकार ने ख़र्चे में ज़बरदस्त कटौती की है। https://t.co/NgEUw33uWb
चूँकि corporate क़र्ज़ माफ़ी के लिए अरबों रुपए हैं सरकार के पास, बच्चों के स्वास्थ के लिए भी तो होने चाहिए। या ये सरकार सिर्फ़ अम्बानी-अदानी के लिए बनी है आम ग़रीब जनता के लिए नहीं @PMOIndia? https://t.co/4QenlWe0ek

@Shabnamchoudh14 @kanhaiyakumar It’s not an absolute number. It’s unemployment *rate*. So population is part of the metric in the denominator. In other words, this shows what % of people are without jobs out of a higher population.

@rishisharmabhu @kanhaiyakumar India was not hit by the global recession (at least not simultaneously) so open unemployment not showing up in that particular year in not surprising. But highest unemp in the year of DeMon, which was the biggest ever shock given to the Indian economy, is proof of its sensitivity

There could be a quid pro quo for such heavily concentrated corporate funding for the BJP. But we will never know since the identity of the funders can never be known because of the electoral bonds system.   https://t.co/pFD48nmax0
#BacktoBasics investing in young children is to be investing in the future of the country - can we afford to ignore them - union budget for ICDS saw a decline in real terms during the #ModiSarkaar https://t.co/QFTl5ObNnU

#7 agriculture continues to be faced with distress - no jobs in non-agriculture and no remuneration in agriculture - stagnant output prices as well as wages - where will people go? #ruraldistress https://t.co/H2wTPzgK1S

Whose #chowkidari is the chowkidar doing? The anganwadi prog contniues to be plagued by corrupt contractors- no action on this!

On the other hand ICDS faces fund cuts - is this the commitment for young children and pregnant and lactating women?

#WahModijiWah #GoodByeModi https://t.co/cMwxJ2HhAj
ICDS saw a massive expansion after SC orders in 2006 - the central govt allocations have slowed down drastically now 

Is this what Maximum Governance, Minimum Government of much needed resources?
