Forget #KabirSingh, I watched #ArjunReddy on @PrimeVideoIN. Felt uncomfortable in my own house.

Director Mr. @imvangasandeep and his movie have earned money, sure. Respect, however, is another matter.

Don't miss @Su4ita's passionate review of this disturbing blockbuster. https://t.co/lcFZe8YdYc
Yup. Scary times. Also, pretty amusing. Here's wishing strength to fragile egos. @imvangasandeep #KabirSingh #ArjunReddy https://t.co/W3GJWDkZiF
@AmazonianPixel @konkonas I love #Maybelline but I have never been able to do wings successfully. Sometimes, I wonder if I should take a MAC makeup tutorial what concerns/disturbs/troubles me most is to see the women who are loving the scummy film - some of them even smart 'intellectual' ones.

Thank you for sharing this, Shephali. I can not even imagine how difficult it must have been to relive that time. Thank you for your courage. Really.
This is what facing a real-life #KabirSingh is like and this is how scary it gets for a young girl. It isn't all rosy with lilting songs playing in the background. It is terror.

Also, HAVE to point out Mr. @imvangasandeep's dishonesty. Early on in the interview, he pretended to not remember @Su4ita's name, but later, unwittingly, he happened to say her full name - surname included. Small lies reveal big truths about a person. https://t.co/Av1geDKSkB
This man's words are deeply disturbing, to say the very least - more disturbing than his film even. And that's no small feat. https://t.co/Av1geDKSkB
