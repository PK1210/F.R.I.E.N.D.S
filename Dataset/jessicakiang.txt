@DonaldClarke63 Honestly feel like my lifelong failure to secure that jacket has a lot to do with that.
@DonaldClarke63 ...doubtless due to DSS' powerful anti-marriage subtext! That's such a sweet story though. It was, believe it or not, the first film I watched as part of my film degree. Followed by BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA. Was all prepped for Eisenstein and Ozu, but got Madonna and Keanu instead.

"Nefertiti! No shit!" My favourite line.
I had the novelization of this film. And there are times I remember phrases from it that aren't in the movie. Some serious imprinting evidently went on.
Peak Hot Quinn. And a projectionist! Swoon.
@JenniferLoeber It was like the first place I went the first time I came to NY! Already wasn't the same, and they didn't even use the same bags :(
@JenniferLoeber Nah I'm all about the jacket. Her swap for those fugly boots was worst trade ever.
Also love how the entire plot revolves around the transformative power of a sparkly jacket. Related: would still kill for that jacket.
We do not talk enough about how adorable Rosanna Arquette is in this film.
Fuck it, I'm watching DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN again.
@mimbale @PaxTobiPax It's very possible. I prefer to hold out hope that's not the case, though.
@Nina_Metz @mimbale @PaxTobiPax *very* interesting. My hope is that since an otherwise fairly scorched-earth story doesn't mention their complicity, they weren't materially involved, but it's true, that could just be me being a Pollyanna.
@mimbale @PaxTobiPax I don't think this was their choice, no. Maybe naive, but until I hear otherwise... At the very least, if this had been their decision, I think it would have been handled with a better sense of the optics.
@StayteRobert Dunno about "forced to"; they may want to! Also imagine they might wait until AA is ready to speak too, which, if it happens at all, yeah, is likely to be after end of season.
@diana_liwen Yes! Only this time, a chorus: the BLL cast is basically a female movie-star/power-broker union, and it would be awesome if they responded as such.
Extremely curious about how Streep/Kidman/Witherspoon are/are not going to respond to this BLL Andrea Arnold story. Because if I were them I'd have the distinct feeling I'd been "managed" and I'd be fucking *furious.*
@MarkHarrisNYC All fair points, but surely the question then is why hire AA at all? If it was just a deliberate sop to an extremely high-wattage female cast, I think HBO does deserve to be called out on that.
Well, that was one of the most beautiful games of tennis I've ever seen.

@Film_Monitor It really will be a fascinating, $280m (rumoured) litmus test, whatever happens!
@Film_Monitor Early word from trailer suggests that while there are authenticity issues, they are but niggles about a project to which, overall, people are receptive.
@Film_Monitor But has Disney ever *targeted* China as forcefully? When 1st MULAN came out, market was a fraction of size, and Disney ban meant it didn't drop till a year after release. SW movies also different -- no history in that market, no nostalgia, not part of culture.
@JustinCChang @GuyLodge We have definitely settled the matata.
@GuyLodge @JustinCChang It's hogwash.
@JustinCChang @GuyLodge Your restraint in not using THE LION KING as an excuse for "give us all paws" is duly noted.
I don't know, that's not the conclusion arrived at in that piece, and I think the CRA comparison is an imperfect one. At the very least, in the context of Disney's growing monopoly, it will be interesting to see if China can withstand this aggressive and unambiguous a courtship. https://t.co/Y3J3w4PfHf

@NicksFlickPicks With Guy on JOSEPH, STUDENT. But also, of your Koreans, THE AGE OF SHADOWS (exceptionally crafted, gorgeous period spy caper) and THE WAILING (genuinely batshit scary horror). MORRIS FROM AMERICA modest but sweet. Docs: ZERO DAYS. Continue to avoid: THE HOLLARS.
The only thing I now remember about STRANGER THINGS s3 (which I watched *yesterday*) is how much lamer the ending was than it could oh-so-very-easily have been.
@thetruemilhouse Do not put words into my mouth; you're bad at it. That is not my line of argument, it is *your* zig-zag, the last in a line of straw men thrown up against the pretty mild observation that capitalist inequality on gender lines has a historical basis in sexism. *That* is my point.
@thetruemilhouse So women are to blame, in the end, for the unequal pay of female sports stars. Gotcha. I really do not know how you have ended up at this conclusion, but good luck with it.
@thetruemilhouse What on earth? How are you making these death-defying leaps in interpretation between what I type and what you want me to mean?
@thetruemilhouse You are *exactly* missing my point: The "capitalist" reason men's sports generate more TV revenue is itself sexist. (Historically, not enough investment in women's game bc girls can't play, don't like sport etc). Or do you think men's sports are just inherently more watchable?
@thetruemilhouse To be honest, I wasn't actually talking about either. I was talking about the fallacious idea that capitalism and sexism are separate issues with no overlap.
@idonthaveaband Amazing how well those traits pair, though, like a fine Malbec and an aged cheddar.
@idonthaveaband Yup, but I think the fallacy in the reasoning lies deeper than that!
@thetruemilhouse What are you trying to prove to me? That my tweet does not solve the problem of pay inequality in international football or that there is no problem?
@thetruemilhouse I do not understand this analogy. The debate to which I am referring is currently airing *because* of the US team and their suit against US soccer. The remuneration structure of the WC is a different issue.
@thetruemilhouse Firstly, in the US, the women's game does not generate less revenue than the men's (see recent WaPo articles). But more broadly, I'd imagine breaking the cycle of "investing more in the men's game because the men's game yields $$ because it gets more investment" is probably key.
@ScotsRecreation Aw, thank you! Great movie.
Lol at all the "it's not sexism, it's capitalism!" responses to the equal pay in football debate which actually imply those two things are not intertwined.
