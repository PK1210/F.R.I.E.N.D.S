Winning this in 5. Let's do this.

Let's go, let's go. Just a break. Just a break.
@iam_mihird That's the only way
Hold, Roger. Hold. Don't lose it now.
@renukaVyavahare Yeah
For the love of everything sacred in tennis and life, please win this set.
Okay Roger, the machine will come at you all guns blazing. Please don't lose concentration. Please. Please. Let's get this third set.
C'mon, Roger. Let's do this in 4.
Right. Let's do this. #Bel21ve

@AwaaraHoon Hate is unfollowing a voice because you don't agree with it. Do you not get it? It is worse than hate, it's blind hate. I genuinely feel sorry that I'm engaging with a chap who thinks I "picked on" his hero randomly. News flash: it is written to his captain.
@AwaaraHoon For a moment just consider that it's not "prejudice" please? Are fanatics capable of giving us normies the credit to form our own opinion? I grew up loving the guy, now I don't. Simple. Also, mature much for hating on a film critic for his sports opinions?
@AwaaraHoon As I said, your loss :)
@AwaaraHoon I wish I could believe you. But your own Dhoni bias prevents you from seeing the humanity of a piece, and I am sorry about that. I hope you grow out of it one day.
@SIDARYANS Thank you, Siddharth. I appreciate it.
@AwaaraHoon Also I feel sad for you that out of all the thoughts in that piece, about life and death, it's a Dhoni ref that stood out for you. Makes total sense, actually. Cheers. Get well soon.
@AwaaraHoon Your loss entirely, sir! (also, trust me, it isn't a phase that I'll "grow out of it")

Cannot watch. Cannot.
I'm gonna develop a heart condition soon, but Roger, I'd die for you if you pull this off.
My life has never been less meaningful than during a Roger-Rafa match. And I love that.
For the love of tennis, PLEASE BREAK.
@iam_mihird Ditto
Aussie Open '17 all over again.
All that emotional investment and we are back to a best-of-3 match. What was even the point of the last two hours
Haan matlab why even fight back from a break down? Give another break. Why do hard work?
Mental walkabout, hello old friend.
If Roger doesn't win this second set, he's finished. I've seen it far too often. I am scarred.
This will be a long night, folks.
Now now, no second set walkabouts, Roger.
