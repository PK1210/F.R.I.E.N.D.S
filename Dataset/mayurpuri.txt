@suzannebernert @RichaChadha But it happens, Suzanne.  You may be responsible odd one out. But I've heard actors' support staff talking about other scripts and why they didn't do so and so movie etc etc. So, the fear from writers / producers side is not irrational. 😁
@RichaChadha Totally agree. A script should be comprehensible and engaging in reading itself. 

Although, (don't @ me please but) the ugly truth of Bollywood is: most actors don't read themselves and give the scripts to managers and hairdressers to summarise for them.

Very interesting indeed. https://t.co/ZVaVm5cdsy
@GhantaGuy If you are traveling from Mumbai the 'ease of reaching there' is moot. Even going to the Airport is saat samundar paar.
@gulshandevaiah Sure. Waise, Books do have a solid impact on society. Even if we don't count the religious biggies like Bible and Bhagwadgita, there are books like Uncle Tom"s Cabin, Das Capital, Poetics, Natyashastra,  Interpretation of Dreams, Origin of Species etc etc. But films, I doubt. 😁
@gulshandevaiah Yes, I'm not denying the influence of films on pop culture, fashion, hairstyles, travel plans etc. But no film can shake the core morality people. You are a good person or you are not. Film dekh ke na koi sadhu banta hai, na shaitan. 🙏🏻
@gulshandevaiah People's moral choices are not impacted by films. We made Dhoom and lots of bikes were sold. But people didn't start robberies because of Dhoom. 2/2.
@gulshandevaiah They are great films, unforgettable as far as story telling and entertainment is concerned. But as far social impact is concerned they are all 'just films'. Naya Daur didn't stop industrialisation. Mother India didn't solve any social issues. 1/2
@herlavishhustle @Shikha_Babu 🖐🏻 more than a few times. 
Sigh! 

But it does make one feel better when you can help another person despite being broken inside.
When you write a film song for the very first time, the director loves it and takes it without a single change and it goes on to become a super hit.
