@oh_itsRoy call me when we get to 'to all the boys i've loved be4"
@tarabitran @THR Tara your life is COOL.
@azThalheimer I don't own one myself despite loving apples and refusing to eat them un-circular sliced, so I don't know what to add here.
Zac Efron has had a YouTube channel for months and I only just found out about it, what the hell.
@Whit_Moore 11, Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (this is depressingly a true story)
@localmistake @ThatDanielOtt goddamnit that sounds rad as hell
@taylorbakken I think it was something from the soundtrack of the South Park movie. don't know if ashamed or very proud.
@oh_itsRoy What the fuck
@oh_itsRoy This is... a lot to handle.

Although yeah Rise of the Machines, not bad at all and maybe pretty good!
Loved it. Fight me in the real world, friends! #GOT
@Whit_Moore @shelbyboring 😞
@Whit_Moore @shelbyboring You weren't going to otherwise??
@alexandrahutson you're going to be very confused, have a blast!!
@oh_itsRoy This picture is adorable!
@oh_itsRoy Roy this is awesome and you know it.
@Whit_Moore But what does it all mean??
@oh_itsRoy stop
@oh_itsRoy To be fair, so would Detective Pikachu.
@oh_itsRoy I liked this by accident while meaning to click the button to refute your point.
@LeeStobby This reaction is honestly still the biggest surprise of the movie to me.
@taylorbakken @oh_itsRoy Stay tuned friends
@oh_itsRoy @taylorbakken Uhh why wasn't I invited to this
@oh_itsRoy does this mean I should finally see Tranformers The Last Knight
Amen. https://t.co/D1NUZmQ6gN
@taylorbakken @oh_itsRoy OMG ROY WHAT ARE YOU DOING
@oh_itsRoy "Come out" in what sense? If it never makes it to theaters, it will at least make it to some streaming platform within two years.
@tarabitran Ahh!!
@oh_itsRoy someone you LOVE ❤️ thx Roy
@LeeStobby Whether they eat the eyeball.
@tarabitran "Five Feet Apart" infuriatingly solves this issue on one of the main character's phones, but then later you see the other one's SAME TEXT CHAIN and NOTHING. They were so close!
@oh_itsRoy Living on a farm and writing YA sci-fi books! This is real.
@azThalheimer I cannot locate myself on a scale that doesn't contain Lagunitas or Fat Tire.
@michellemaemax I'm pretty confident I could do it.

@oh_itsRoy @davidehrlich Hey stop blowing up my spot!!
@oh_itsRoy A STAR IS BORN &gt; THE FAVOURITE &gt; ROMA &gt; BLACKKKLANSMAN &gt; BLACK PANTHER &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; GREEN BOOK &gt; VICE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
@oh_itsRoy can it now officially be considered a cult classic?
@oh_itsRoy 😍
@oh_itsRoy also Ethan Hawke is one of my three favorite actors but Bradley Cooper deserves the win for A Star Is Born. Thank you this has been me annoying you for the morning.
@oh_itsRoy The movie was not my cup of tea, but Rami Malek is fantastic in it. I have seen as many as four actual movies.
@oh_itsRoy Will Ferrell is *also* a producer on Vice! (at least technically)
@oh_itsRoy Don't worry Roy someday you will also get screeners.
@norkzorgler Whoa.
@JewOnYourFloor if it helps, Shrek aggressively does not hold up anyways

alt tweet: as long as he doesn't have ryan reynolds' voice
@dylansquinn Darn straight I'm real!
@DavidNForIdaho @CityofMoscowId @LatahCountyID Woo-hoo!
@taylorbakken I don't even know what A Bread Factory is but obviously that
@dylansquinn Oh hello.
Happy Halloween from me, Crying Baby Driver! @edgarwright https://t.co/C9gXzKDy5c
@norkzorgler No sane people do
@oh_itsRoy ...yes.
@oh_itsRoy Makes sense though, doesn't it?
@tarabitran @Carter_Friend There's no way this opens to more than 9 million dollars and that's going to be me and Carter seeing it a half million times each opening weekend.
@oh_itsRoy The Walk, but then also Flight and Cast Away.

@oh_itsRoy Welcome to Marwen in theaters this Christmas just for you bud
@oh_itsRoy Saw it for my 10th birthday party my friend.
@oh_itsRoy probably not technically
@oh_itsRoy Uncle Drew does not appreciate your shade.
@taylorbakken @oh_itsRoy Guys I’m so sorry.
@oh_itsRoy Equal blame must go to those who didn't see American Made.
@oh_itsRoy Only one looks way more interesting.
@marc__finn why have you never offered to get matching tattoos with me asshole
RT @MarkDuplass: I think about San Junipero all the time.

@oh_itsRoy (I actually don't have a firm opinion on this yet but)
@oh_itsRoy hi roy
@oh_itsRoy honestly yeah
@oh_itsRoy fun fact: so did Harry and the Hendersons!
@funk_shui No luck.
@oh_itsRoy In this scenario is it still a bad movie?
@oh_itsRoy A GIANT DUCK ALONE DOES NOT MAKE A MOVIE.
@oh_itsRoy Jesus Christ dude.
@azThalheimer Every time they offer me the chance to skip intro on 'Friends' I get angry-- who would ever.
@azThalheimer @oh_itsRoy try harder next time
@oh_itsRoy dude don’t do it just rewatch San Andreas
@oh_itsRoy no, roy
@azThalheimer @taylorbakken It was a matter of time before it happened to somebody.
@taylorbakken regret just increased tenfold
@taylorbakken damn it, I missed my chance when I went through airport security right behind him
@azThalheimer You’re welcome for that paranoia.
@oh_itsRoy Let's get this going at Netflix man.
@oh_itsRoy what a cruel twist of fate that it would turn out to be your beloved lady bird
@oh_itsRoy *Adam Sandler needs you
@taylorbakken You are in the Sunken Place.
@oh_itsRoy Now improbably more excited.
@oh_itsRoy @taylorbakken guys I too plz?
@oh_itsRoy god help me man I’m still gonna watch Bright the day it drops https://t.co/RCyOtVuA5E
@azThalheimer @oh_itsRoy This is clutch https://t.co/GdDjtZDuW0
@oh_itsRoy I'm being so serious
@casey_williams5 @taliacandler Would subscribe
@azThalheimer @taylorbakken If you guys could grab me an iced matcha with oat milk that would be 👌🏼
@oh_itsRoy Thank you for informing me that this exists.
RT @davidehrlich: is it too late to reshoot all of Mel Gibson’s scenes in DADDY’S HOME 2? it doesn’t open until 5pm tomorrow.
I love Criterion, but someone needs to advocate for the preservation of shitty films. If we're not careful Drive Angry could be lost to time
@oh_itsRoy just so everyone knows Roy likes this movie
@oh_itsRoy That literally broke my brain.
