@aaliaaaliya @TheRealPCB The team that adapts best will get the right result!! 🇵🇰 have to win all games now to remain in the contest and qualify further!! 
Inshallah 🇵🇰 will come stronger against mighty india!
@mak_asif @aaliaaaliya @TheRealPCB Our batters led us down! Anyways its gone now!  I hope Pakistan will do their homework perfectly and execute well in the next game!
@aaliaaaliya @TheRealPCB I agree!! We should stop calling ourselves unpredictable and should start taking this sport seriously!! Teams &amp; individual players who will make less mistakes , play confidently &amp; with bravery that team will win! I dont see any other rocket science!😐
Pakistan has started really well, cautious and nice!! Rotating the strike and punishing bad balls and respecting good balls🙂 
Mashallah our batters looks rock solid !! Keep it up larko!

All those who are criticising my tweet should listen to Anjum Chopra and Alan Wilkins views on penalising Pakistan with 10 bonus runs. 
Umpires should have spoken to the new batter not to run on the danger area of pitch or otherwise team will be penalised again! 
Period.
@budweizer2310 Thats okay, but law should be uniform! Sometimes Matches can be win or loose by just one runs!
First warning was fair but the second one was a little harsh!! 
No batter runs intentionally on the dangerous zone of the wicket!! I think that was a harsh decision from the umpires to gift 10 runs to India!!
This needs to be discussed for future games!
#INDvPAK
Brilliant approach from our batters today!!
Great rotation of strike and sensible shots put pressure on Indian bowlers and fielders!!
