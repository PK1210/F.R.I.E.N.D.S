@lonewolfrs1 @greatbong I have successfully not done a PhD.
@greatbong I've done every single thing in that list. So I have another list :)
At least here, we finally have a number 4 batsman. https://t.co/ETQ2h4NeWN
In case you are wondering why Sachin Tendulkar was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame only now, it's because we have to wait for 5 years after retirement.
#HintHint
Look. It’s always boundaries that separate winners and losers. Usually national boundaries though. 
#CricketWorldCupFinal
I think every wicket should be automatically reviewed by 3rd umpire. Plus 2 unsuccessful reviews for bowling team. Done. ICC, please send me the cheque.
#ENGvsNZ
Dharmasena is an anagram of "Aa! He DRS man."
So, @ABVan &amp; I ran a small, private, tournament fantasy game for the World Cup. 
And I just need to ward off @greatbong for one game to claim 1st place. With @MaheshShankarS close at our heels.
You want to play next time? Go to https://t.co/i33VHFf36B  and enter off email. https://t.co/HifdOEI9UJ
In 1996, Azharuddin. Now, Amarinder Singh.
Navjot Singh Siddhu really doesn't get along with captains.
@ruhimishraa I don't see NZ indulging any more or for that matter any less fair play than any other team.
#ENGvsNZ 
And I don't understand this New Zealand suddenly becoming "nice guys", "nice guys". Why? Because they are being kind to the ball and not hitting it hard?
#CWC19Final #ENGvsNZ
I am supporting England. So that this trend, since 2011, of home-team winning continues, and can be extended to 2023.
@vivekpavani @Deepans99709262 @Anirudh__Ramesh Ok
@Deepans99709262 @Anirudh__Ramesh Doesn't work like that.
@Anirudh__Ramesh We'd have been the home team. So they would have worn red.
I'd also like to assign a little bit of blame on South Africa for unnecessarily beating Australia.
ICC, next time please go with the IPL format where the top 2 in the league stage play a qualifier.
#INDvNZ
@vikramchandra Yes yes. Robust theory based on big data and deep learning.
Dei telecaster. When you showing replay of wicket, put one big “replay” graphic no. I’m watching a distant TV in an airport and getting heart attacks.
Pretty indecent of Neesham to publicly drop Pant.
Just what we need now - Two guys who know how to keep wicket.
Am pretty happy that the next World Cup is in India...
#INDvNZ https://t.co/gAv5MHPKwY
@ABVan @subjudiced Of course, if it gets abandoned, or decided by just a super-over (without a tie happening),, then no points.
@ABVan @subjudiced Yeah. We just update score for this game as and when it finishes.
@TeenageOld haha
#INDvNZ
C'MON INDIA. Get your hands on the World Cup... https://t.co/mK0uzQZO9R
#INDvsSL
Am hoping Jadeja will do his Bits today And shred the Sri Lankan middle order to Pieces.
#PAKvBAN
Hang on. Pakistan can still qualify if the Bangladesh batsmen score negative runs by running backwards.
@anandteke True
@anandteke Very interesting. Makes sense at first glance, but will have to see corner cases. Also making balls margin equivalent to runs margin (after all you are adding them up) works when run a ball is par score. Won't work in T20s for example. Also D/L?
#Budget2019
Am pretty sure that #NirmalaSitharaman has watched "Indru Poi Naalai Vaa" in her childhood. She keeps switching to Hindi when ek gaon mein ek kisaan comes up.
@greatbong @maxdavinci Every run that Bairstow and Root are hitting is poking my heart.
90-year old Motilal Vora is a good choice for Congress interim president.
After all, he is old enough to remember a time when the party wasn't run by the family.
#AmbatiRayudu, don't retire, please wait for a day or two.
Jasprit Bumrah, please arrange for Rayudu's entry.
@sidvee @ABVan Like I told @ABVan, ready to put as long as it is about strong opinions based on imaginary facts :)
R.I.P. Lee Iacocca. 
Dunno about Ford Mustang and all. For me, you were the inventor of business books with popular appeal.
@sidvee Heard some 3-4 of your podcasts yesterday. Most interesting and fun. @ABVan
Feels good to have the best batsman and the best bowler in the world in our team.
#INDvBAN
Haha. Inexperienced Bangladesh. Trying to win the match with 4 wickets in hand rather than working at improving NRR while getting eliminated.
Apple ad:
"Shot on iPhone" - Wow! Nice.
"Additional hardware and software used" - Dei!!!
@ABVan Haha.
@ajith27 Please add more options to the poll - https://t.co/OwBc5S78GF
#INDVBAN
Enjoying watching Kohli's drives.
On-drive, cover-drive, square-drive during the game.
And auto-drive, taxi-drive during the ad breaks.
@asmgn Changed accordingly :)
#INDvBAN
Hmm! In order to go crazy in last 10 overs, we need to keep our wickets. 
Eureka! Four wicket-keepers.
#SelfThoo
Just caught up on the Zaira Wasim story. While it's completely her choice,  I have only one thing to say -
If art &amp; creativity are in conflict with some religion, please question the religion, not the art.
Dear Mr. Shastri,

Am in receipt of your mail where you've asked:
1. How to know which is spinning track, seaming track, etc?
2. What do we do now that Vijay Shankar has left?

I'll get back to you shortly with my inputs on these.

Sri Sri Srivats Baba

PS: Have DM'd bank details
Had a great week in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia courtesy @traveldotearth and @rrrshangrila. 
Among other things, I ziplined from one island to another. So, I plan to be the 22nd Phantom once I get my costume stitched. https://t.co/F6nB9J8WKV
And please, please. Please don't criticise Dhoni. He is a great player, who has won numerous matches for us, been a fabulous captain, and was instrumental in bringing energy into the Indian team by getting rid of Dravid, Laxman &amp; Sehwag when he thought they were past their prime.
Just one last point before I move on from #INDvENG -
If you are trying to improve NRR, and you have 5 wickets in hand, with 5 overs to go,  you try and score runs, not save wickets till the last over.
Okay, thank you. Over to #INDvBAN.
I leave the exercise area, shower and toilet for you to decide.
That time of the year again when India becomes a gym with...
Mumbai as the swimming pool.
Chennai as the steam bath.
Delhi as the sauna.
And Bengaluru as the nice air-conditioned reception area.
Dear Ravi Shastri,

As discussed, please find attached, your 11s for the remaining 4 games.

Regards
SriSriSrivatsBaba https://t.co/V0JzNoX40k
@sidvee Oh, I thought that's the required run rate
Looks like Shastri told Pant - "Go, throw your bat around."
@AjayYek How right. He seems to have already reached there.
#INDvENG
Virat Kohli - Started in Master Mode. Currently in God Mode. Will soon enter Monster Mode.
@ABVan Get to 230 types in 40 overs.
@ABVan Patience, patience.
#INDvENG
Shami takes death bowling quiet literally. Either you die or I die.
@maxdavinci @greatbong @ABVan 2 quick games for India da. But all based on Indian bowlers getting 10 wickets, which is not happening.
@Happy_Mogambo Haha. Hi-5.
#INDvENG 
Sachin Tendulkar's commentary has effectively slowed England down.
@kartikmurali Maybe he still shows a quick pair of heels.
#INDvENG
Excellent tactics by India to get Jadeja in as a substitute fielder every single match.
#INDvENG
India, please go and change back into blue uniform please.
@Happy_Mogambo Exactly :)
#INDvENG
I don't understand why it's called a "missed review", and not an "umpiring error".
@sidvee Groundwork was done for this over a week back, i.e. day or two after Pant joined the squad - https://t.co/h3cYeKgDti
@EuginiaKObuone :) Tamil slang. Closest phrase would be "jus like that". For no reason :)
Reasons for wanting England to lose today -
Ind: Er.. so that we win and qualify.
Aus: So that we don't face India in the semis.
NZ: So that we are guaranteed to qualify.
Pak, Ban, SL: So that we have a chance of qualifying.
Afg, SA, WI: Chumma.
#INDvENG
@meajay Same thing is true of Vimal Pan Masala also, no?
Feeling a bit sad that Modi seems to have stopped greeting world leaders with a hug.
Was much more fun when he belonged to the Be Jhappi party.
I like the new Indian team jersey, but am wondering why cricket needs an "away" jersey. The guys with the bat are batting team. Rest are bowling team. Difficult to get confused, no?
@joybhattacharj @marasim135 Haha. Mumbai apartments do have halls. Only, they are not Wes, but Less.
@rananthu Just transiting.
@joybhattacharj @marasim135 I named a room in my house after Wes Hall.
@MaheshShankarS @sumank Hahaha
At Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. Good demo that Peak load can sometimes exceed Cloud infrastructure. https://t.co/M9avpvhy9X
It's not about whether Vijay Shankar is good or not. It's just that Dhawan needs to be replaced by a batsman, not an extra bowling option. One of Shankar/Jadhav can play. Our bowlers may cover this up, but still not optimal. https://t.co/X5ZqJqqaZG
#INDvWI
From next match, all batsman should be instructed to walk up to Dhoni after every single over and whisper, "Boss, last over."
Am happy that we are rotating strike excellently in the death overs.
#INDvsWI 
Three groups in India who need love, attention and development - 
Middle Class.
Middle Age.
Middle Order.
@redstupid Why wait?
@hydbadshah I can read Hindi. But need to concentrate :)

@jessie_paul @dhempe @sabahtourism @rrrshangrila @MAS @malindoair @plus530 @pvprakash @TechButthead @pythoroshan @Vaishnavioffl @nivedithg @NakulShenoy @captainshanky Getting there this evening. Cya soon.
I see that Dhoni has joined the pantheon of modern Indian Gods who you are not supposed to say a word against.
@ShatrughanSingh @greatbong @maxdavinci @ABVan Thanks. Will get it back at some point at least just for fun :)
@ShatrughanSingh @greatbong @maxdavinci @ABVan Decided to learn tech in my old age, and created https://t.co/s6jmihsmEw 
Private, for now :)
@greatbong @maxdavinci @ABVan Used up my extra subs to make a side punt each game. And they all failed :). Pooran, Hafeez, Sarkar, tchah.
Those days: Nostalgia means B&amp;W videos.
These days: Nostalgia means 4:3 videos.
@anandvkris Okay, then we should replace one of the all-rounders with a batsman - DK/Pant
May I recommend Dhoni at 4, Pant at 5, Hardik at 6, And pick only one of Kedar/Shankar (depending on pitch) and let him float depending on wickets. And if Shami is playing instead of Bhuvi, get Jaddu for Kuldeep.

Okay, got it.
West Indies is overrated. Bangladesh is underrated.

@srini_ramamohan @sidvee Yes yes. The #thoo has standards.
@sidvee #Thoo :)
#INDvsPAK 
May I request all the fans in Manchester to go in to the ground and lie down so that the outfield is covered. Please.
#INDvsPAK
Vijay Shankar nicely judged the length of the ball, and used the breadth of his bat to hit the ball to an ideal depth for a single.
Good 3D batting.
#INDvsPAK 
Summary of first 10 overs -
India: 53 runs.
Pakistan: 0 wickets.
Star Sports: 47 ads.
@Thilak_Rama Just invite them home to watch the match. Get them away from the switch :)
@vidhu56 Haha yes. He is romancing his counterpart in Yelahanka Electricity Board.
Meanwhile the Bengaluru electricity board guy in charge of Jakkur is celebrating every run by turning the power off and on.
@iamraymaguire It's not over-confidence. On current strength &amp; form, we are a much better side. Sure we can lose. It's a game.
#IndiaVsPakistan
Why all this fuss, I say? I can understand Pakistan hyping up this match. From their POV, it's a game against their "big, bad neighbour". 
For us, it's just a chance to get 2 easy points. 
Her's hoping India does just that, and the rain stays away.
@Mallufideintent @sidin Can't. Both Dhawan and Congress have hand injuries.
@sidin Okay, to go a step further, he will get Vijay Mallya back with Kohinoor in his pocket.
@sidin Maybe he has gone to get the Kohinoor back?
Mamata: Arey, Modi made surgeons go on strike. I made doctors go on strike. Why only criticise me?
Advisor: Er... madam, you have misunderstood surgical strike.
@Gautamsays Only if wins are equal. This is a rule that football needed to avoid draws. Makes no sense in limited overs cricket..
#INDvNZ
Match abandoned. And ICC has a bizarre rule that in case of a tie, the team with higher wins goes through. As if, these two teams voluntarily played out a boring draw and so, should be penalised.
@Dracaarrys Yeah man.
@Dracaarrys If raining after toss is unfortunate, giving spectators less overs just to avoid this "disadvantage" is more unfortunate.
@BonySen https://t.co/tuDimXcmYC
@Dracaarrys Don't give them the option. Simple. Exactly what would happen if rain starts after the toss.
Good point. Why not get the toss out of the way, so the game can start faster?
Also why do umpires have to make these lordly scheduled "inspections". Just hang around and do what's needed to get the game started, no? https://t.co/p6YMsyR65u
Quick guide to field-placings this World Cup -
Long On? Down the wicket on the leg side.
Fine Leg? Behind the wicket on the leg side.
Point? Square of the wicket on the off side.
Covers? Er... everywhere on the ground.
#INDvNZ
I don’t think Bengaluru traffic has the concept of “peak hour”. It’s all peaks. Nandi Hills at midnight. Nilgiris at noon. Western Ghats at other times. And Himalayas at commute time.
@sidvee Hehe
@Anxious_Indian @rant_e_azam Misguided one at that. Nothing wrong with "rains come".
@niSHULk_filmcri @Aayush_Gupta66 @rajudasonline I'm talking about not a new innings, Just continue the ld one with whatever wickets have fallen.
#AUSvPAK 
Boss, ICC, quickly make both teams play 20 overs before rains come. Then do the remaining 30 overs each. Telling you as a friend.
@ivaradanS I was there most of last week. Still sweating at the memory.
@singersrinivas Haha. At least you can never say - Winter is coming.
Yesterday, Southampton, SA vs WI - Washout.
Today, Bristol, BAN vs SL - Probably washed out.
Tomorrow, Taunton, AUS vs PAK - 50% chance of rain.
Thursday, Nottingham, IND vs NZ - 80% chance of rain.
Nonsense World Cup.
@meajay Yes yes. Thank you for a polished evening - Two polished people having polished conversation while polishing off a couple of bottles.
I think #CrazyMohan would like his epitaph to read -
R.I.P.-roaringly funny.

Okay. Revenge has been taken for 2003. Semis, we'll take revenge for 2015.
#INDvAUS
353 to win. NDA did that a few weeks back.
@IndiGo6E Please please allow me to modify my flight or cancel it. I've been trying for 45 minutes now. But your website is more violent than your staff.

Tchah! Very bad. Why so late? Rahul Gandhi went to see his mother immediately after the elections. https://t.co/POPRDBVhDa
Hmm! Congress is facing a deficit of over 200.
And they already have a Rahul. 
So, obviously, they now need VVS Laxman.
@krishashok Makes me feel happy that I am so loaded with energy.
Modi: Every cell in my body belongs to the nation.
Mamata: Every body in my nation belongs in a cell.
So, Rahul Gandhi took 5 years to move from 44 to 55. Only Chanderpaul was slower.
Vivek Oberoi must be getting ready to shoot 2-3 hours more footage.
My worry is that Mamata may be planning to put half the population of West Bengal in jail.
#Electionsresults2019
I like this NDTV graphic where they show the Lok Sabha slowly filling up with saffron, grey and blue MPs, who are so pleasantly silent and well-behaved.
#ElectionResults2019
@rahulroushan Hehe. True, that.
@kbalakumar What else is it? :)
Today, Prannoy Roy will deeply analyse the patterns. Arnab will loudly proclaim the results. And after it's all over, and he knows what happened, Rajdeep will insightfully tell us why it happened.
@magicumesh Always more fun to troll the ruling party :)
@jlo_azad All the spokespersons :)
Last day of play. 272 to win. Scorers are ready. Umpires are watching. Bowlers ready to add spin. Nightwatchmen at the crease. This is most thrilling. 
#ElectionResults2019
Okay, my last tweet on GoT. (Spoiler alert)
The real victims of the series were the poor denizens of King's Landing:

Hopeless.
@rajyashw Bram was too bad
I wish this election would end fast, so we can be done with nastiness, and get back to politics. Sigh!
Dammit! Good night. Hope at least the Targereyan-Stark team wins tomorrow morning.
@raghavbala Yes yes. One big family we are. :)
@hydbadshah Dammit ! :)
@ABVan Watson magic to cement his place in your all-time IPL XI

@hydbadshah @RCBTweets Glamour? :)
This is the story of the IPL 2019 play-offs. 
C'MON EXPERIENCE... https://t.co/Ajq2JWBWSP
Time Magazine calls Modi "India's Divider in Chief".
His opponents calls him an authoritarian Ruler.
His followers see him as their Compass, and hope he has a Protracted rule.
Frankly, Modi is sounding more and more like a Geometry Box.
Five years back: "Modi will be better than every past PM."
Now: "Every past PM was worse than Modi."
Hmm! Comes to the same thing, I guess.
Perhaps Virat could take a vacation on a ship called INS Rajiv, and square things up.
@The_Karthik @krishashok Ah ok.
@vasi001 Haha. Yes.
@The_Karthik @krishashok All very good. But where was the letter used?
You know what. If that no-ball were given, RCB would have actually qualified. Tchah!
@krishashok Because I have never seen ash used except in this role.
@krishashok I've always wondered why the letter "akh" existed before "f" came along. And if it was only introduced as a modifier to change p to f, why not save trouble and introduce f instead.
Want love? - Go to Tinder.
Want hate? - Come to Twitter.
Why have otherwise normal (quite smart) people escalated their political opinion to some sort of religious bigotry?
Same blind faith. Same lack of logic. Same hate. Same self-righteousness. Actually, same predictable boringness. 
Why da?
It's okay Virat. Send those red and black clothes for dry-cleaning, and let's BRING OUT THE BLUE.
#RCBvsSRH 
If Kohli had just asked, I'm sure KKR would have lent Russell to RCB for this game.
This election is going on for too long. Maybe they should give the results after each phase and make the process thrilling.
Well, technically speaking, every time the KKR players go for a jog, you could say that SRK is exercising his franchise.

Seriously, Night King, why couldn't you fight during the day? Oh ok, I get it.
@sidin It's just a tribute to the uniform of CSK, who excel in the 20 over format.
I appreciate PM Modi for trying to remove black money from India.
But I wish he would refrain from trying to make sure every other colour money is present. https://t.co/dq0DoEaEe5

In 2010 only, I had suggested that Sachin Tendulkar's birthday be celebrated as Runmashtami. Still waiting.
Would have been far more fun if Akshay Kumar had dressed up as Arnab and interviewed Vivek Oberoi dressed up as Modi.
@raincloudg Didn't know that. Deleted.
@chaitanyadj Oh. okay okay. Didn't know he was injured. Will quietly delete.
@anuragsingh22_ Oho! Deep :)
Good thing: CSK will win the IPL even ten years from now.
Bad thing: Other teams would have give up by then.
Frightening thing: It will be the same 11.
