It’s important to note that most assembly seats where Trinamool Congress has highest votes border Bangladesh and assembly seats where BJP gets maximum votes border Jharkhand and Bihar. The darkness of colours in the @IndiaToday DIU map mirror voteshare. https://t.co/MuAmCXlnhB https://t.co/JCKhjLNY3u

Maywati walked out of Gathbandan blaming Akhilesh for not delivering Yadav votes. But the BSP Chief is reading 2019 results wrong. Akhilesh brought Yadav+Muslim votes to the table. It’s Non-Jatav Dalits who chose Modi over Maya. @indiatoday DIU insights: https://t.co/GQjbwCcMbM https://t.co/W5Tmsd1O8A
