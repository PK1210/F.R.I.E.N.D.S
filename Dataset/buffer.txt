@DigitalEprTools Let us know if this doesn't work! -Ross
@roadsidephil Hey Phil! Sorry for the issue here. This is a display issue with our web platform. If you login via mobile you should be able to delete them. Sorry for the rough workaround until we get this fixed, but hope it helps! -Ross
@MarciSischo I'm sorry about the holdup, Marci! Could you DM us the email address you're using so we can take a look on our side?  -Kelly https://t.co/7POxMH7a7o
@AllAnimeMag Oh no üôàWe definitely want to see if we can get the two tools to play nice with each other. Could you DM us so we can work through next steps?  -Kelly https://t.co/7POxMH7a7o
@methodandmetric Sorry for the confusing queue count! We're experiencing a bug with our queue where failed posts don't show up in the web version. Could you try logging into the mobile app to delete them from there? Let us know how that goes for you! ü§û -Kelly
@Eastmagazines If you continue to run into trouble, let us know and we'll be happy to help out! -Essence
@Eastmagazines I‚Äôm so sorry about the trouble here! It looks like your post failed back on the 11th -- at the time, Twitter was experiencing an outage that impacted many customers, sadly. Retrying your post should do the trick!  -Essence
@scott_peterson4 Here's a link! -Ross https://t.co/7POxMH7a7o
@scott_peterson4 Hey Scott! Can you send us a DM? From there we can generate a new password for you.  -Ross
@DigitalEprTools From there, you can remove the Buffer app within Facebook and then go through the ‚ÄúReconnect‚Äù within Buffer to reauthorize - accepting all Pages and Instagram accounts. Let us know how things go! We‚Äôre here if you need any help along the way! -Essence
@DigitalEprTools I'm so sorry for the ongoing Instagram trouble here! Let's take a deeper look into this. By any chance, have you tried removing the Buffer app entirely from Facebook's Business Integration settings? If not, you can do that here: https://t.co/qW8tHgbTEk -Essence
@scott_peterson4 Hey Scott! Yep, we're moving all of our accounts over to email since it gives us a more solid way to keep accounts separated directly from social accounts. You'll want to pick an email to associate the account with and that will get everything set for you moving forward :) -Ross
@Chris_Yeung98 Double the buff! Have a great workout, Chris! :) -Ross
@fienen Hey Michael! Really sorry for that poor experience here. I'll flag this up with our team! -Ross
@Ayunda_Zi Sure thing! If you click on the account menu, which is the top right corner in Publish, then click Preferences, you can delete your Publish and Analyze accounts there, or if you share your email address and confirm the last 4 digits of your Buffer account, I can sort it! -Dave
@maxhofmann21 In the meantime, you can translate posts into different languages then schedule them in your queues manually~ -Essence
@maxhofmann21 That said, I think this is a great idea for a new feature. Would you be up for sharing this over at https://t.co/UwpuVVPiXI to give our product team a nudge? -Essence
@maxhofmann21 Thanks for getting in touch, Max! I'd be happy to help out. At this time, we don't have a feature within Publish that allows you to translate a single post into multiple languages. I'm really sorry about that!  -Essence

@devomase Sorry about this! We're experiencing a bug on our web dashboard that isn't showing failed posts in the queue. If you log into the Buffer mobile app, however, you should be able to delete those posts. Could you try that and let us know how it goes? -Kelly
@ronaldnztan @Hootsuite_Help Hi Ronald! Great question. We're only able to automatically post to Instagram Business accounts. We aren't able to post to Creator accounts just yet! If/when this becomes possible, we'll be sure to let you know! -Kelly
@SpinLabLeipzig Hey friends! Sure thing, there should be an option to activate a trial from here: https://t.co/lqCJIVexwp -Dave

@NitzanSchwarz I'm sorry about this, Nitzan! We have a known bug where failed posts aren't displaying on the web version of Buffer. To delete those posts, you should be able to hop into the Buffer mobile app to see them. Could you give that a try and let us know how it goes either way? -Kelly
@MitkaYanakieva Hey Mitka! Shop Grid is currently only available on Premium and Business plans. Here's a bit of more info about those plans: https://t.co/McpQcWK7OV -Ross
@SilkFloralArt I'm so sorry about this! We're bumping into a bug that is preventing failed posts in the queue from showing. Our team is looking into a fix but in the meantime, you should be able to delete the posts from the mobile app. Could you give that a try &amp; let us know how it goes? -Kelly
@jobvennekens Woo! I'm glad that worked for you, Job :) If we can help with anything else as you go, just let us know. Have a great week ahead! -Kelly
@We_Are_Flow Just followed up! üôå -Dave
@GalloiseBlonde Sorry about this. We have a bug where failed posts are not showing. Our engineers are aware of this and we hope to have a fix soon. In the meantime, these posts will show up in the mobile app where you can delete or retry them. Please let me know if you have any questions -Dave
@DigitalEprTools Hey there! https://t.co/rkmZA5QRxK isn't our tool so it may be best to reach out to them directly for technical support. So sorry we can't be of more assistance here! -Ross

‚ÄúRobin Li, principal at GGV Capital, believes that as more e-commerce and direct-to-consumer brands are looking to diversify their marketing mixes, they should be more open about sharing what's working for them on different channels.‚Äù https://t.co/RzmZuluN7T
