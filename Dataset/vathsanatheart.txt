It's interesting how @Nanditasweta's role shapes up in #Kalki, the suspense is delectably built. Self-deprecating humour from @ActorRajasekhar, an assured act by @eyrahul, there's so much to like in it. The multi-layered premise, the background score, it surely deserved more love
If not for the uncalled-for item number, @PrasanthVarma in #Kalki shows his class to do a genre-bender of a film with elements of horror, drama and thriller driven by a mythological twist. A rare Telugu film that places such emphasis on the making as much as the story.
A late viewing, but was stoked by #Kalki at the theatres. @PrasanthVarma shows such refined understanding of the medium. Bridging mythology, history and commercial sensibilities in a single film with such assurance, here's someone who truly respects the audience's intelligence.

RT @saaatyaki: @PranitaRavi @vathsanatheart @deepuzoomout Portrayal of misogyny &amp; entitlement shouldn't be misconstrued as their endorsemen‚Ä¶
@PranitaRavi @deepuzoomout Of course they can be discussed, but that needn't be the only point of discussion.
If tales like #LipstickUnderMyBurkha, #VeereDiWedding and #LustStories were hailed as progressive cinema just because they had endorsed sexual liberation of women, what's your issue with #KabirSingh? Let this be a level-playing field #Bollywood media.
The character #KabirSingh isn't a poster boy of masculinity. He's just a problematic guy dealing with his own stuff. The film has so many men who aren't as brash as him. As if feminity isn't toxic sometimes? So you expect a rebellious youngster to turn a priest by the climax?
Looks like the Hindi reviewers of #KabirSingh just can't take the fact that the film's protagonist is flawed and self-destructive and the story is merely being told from his perspective. He's problematic yes, but stop conveniently referring to the term toxic-masculinity.
@PranitaRavi @crhemanth Maybe, yes. But I never drove a car later. My life is still complete without a car and I don't intend to buy one in the future too. Journalism is enough of a pressure cooker, so why need another head ache on the roads?
@PranitaRavi @crhemanth I told if women are driving well, good for them. He was too much into his philosophy to understand gender. I didn't pay him the last installment on purpose.
@crhemanth At the car driving school I went, a trainer had once told, 'Even girls drive better than you. Have some shame. Be a man' I was speechless.

This story in @DeccanHerald holds a special spot in my heart because of the effort that went into it. In researching, understanding about textiles and a 91-year-old woman #SuraiyaHasanBose who continues to make life brighter for the weavers. Glad someone pushed me to do this! https://t.co/PeCsNPN85W
Just how lovely is #Kaafir, a beautiful story where humanity triumphs over nationalism and jingoism. @deespeak has probably given the best performance in her career, a wonderful supporting act from @mohituraina as well, @chink_ster you have a winner in your hands. @ZEE5India üëç
A wonderful review of #GameOver by @rachitbkc, haven't watched the film but this is written so well! https://t.co/aVUt5wtmMM
@crhemanth Yes, they did, owing to a clause I believe.
@crhemanth Heard that the director backed out of both the projects halfway and someone else finished the films!
