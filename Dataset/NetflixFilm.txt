Oh, and in the name of ~academic~ genre theory: https://t.co/1xLjc4YDVc
All that said, everything turns out OK for Brenda, right? https://t.co/Cc51g0bN0o
As Professor of Psychology Chase O'Gwin told @bustle in 2018, "When people are made to vicariously live an experience, it forces them to ask questions of themselves, 'What would I do?'" https://t.co/xV2bNvix3c
Generally speaking, we like to watch this genre because we internalize the characters‚Äô struggles. We want to believe that we‚Äôd be able to anticipate where things are headed, and that we‚Äôd be smart, perceptive, and strong enough to survive. https://t.co/OZHFJe5Ynp
The good news in these films is there‚Äôs usually a detective on the case who‚Äôs asking all the right questions ‚Äî usually about name kerfuffles. (FWIW Amnesia-based name-switcharoos can be traced back as far as Greta Garbo‚Äôs AS YOU DESIRE ME (1932)). https://t.co/omEUo2sQ91
But just to be clear bad husbands are always bad no matter what they say. https://t.co/twTT2TfkMi
In the 1940s, ‚Äúamnesia noir‚Äù had a heyday with post-war films like SPELLBOUND (1945) and THE OCTOBER MAN (1947). We love to watch characters struggle to remember because neither they nor we know if they did something bad in the past.
But then, of course, comes the amnesia. https://t.co/AWArcMPliZ
These two people? Totally on the same page. https://t.co/XFebqVWmAu
In most all of these films, there‚Äôs a push and pull on if the husband is good or the husband is bad. As for Brenda‚Äôs, he‚Äôs good, we promise. These glasses are definitely real and not at all fake. What a catch! https://t.co/XSyrCINOBp
An example of jeopardy is quite literally JEOPARDY (1953) in which a woman agrees to become her kidnapper‚Äôs husband (intellectual) in order to save her real husband‚Äôs life (physical).
Language differs: Woman in Peril / Distress / Jeopardy each express a varying degree of physical danger, intellectual danger, or both.
OK back to Brenda. It‚Äôs usually about more than love. Often the man is interested in the woman for money, or vice versa. This is why we often see the two of them falling in questionable love inside incredible homes that look like showrooms for Restoration Hardware. https://t.co/SbSfOjW48D
And while we‚Äôre here we may as well acknowledge that there many instances from the silent era in which the *woman* saves the *man* including BLUE JEANS (1917)!! https://t.co/PPBOIT5VLg
(Worth noting that in the silent era it was rare to see kidnapped women tied to train tracks. This trope appeared less often than we think ‚Äî and when it did, it was usually for ironic comedy.)
First off, it‚Äôs been around for quite some time. Some film theorists trace the genre back to classics like GASLIGHT (1944) and REBECCA (1940). Decades before those even, silent films like BACK TO GOD‚ÄôS COUNTRY (1919) dealt with similar plots of ‚Äúcapture.‚Äù https://t.co/Yzi7I4jTlm
In the name of Brenda Song, let‚Äôs break down everyone‚Äôs SECRET OBSESSION with the Woman in Peril thriller.
Since the dawn of time (or at least the dawn of cinema), women in movies have been wronged by men pretending to be their husbands. And yet, we love to ‚Äúfind out‚Äù there‚Äôs trouble in paradise. How does this genre keep happening?! https://t.co/mY6v9djssP

Come for Ho Wi Ding's beautiful, textured world, stay for a handful of charged performances from Jack Kao, Lee Hong-chi, Xie Zhang-ying, and Ding Ning. CITIES OF LAST THINGS is now available on Netflix.
Speaking of triptychs that explore masculinity and Wong Kar-wai-influenced films‚Ä¶ We have a feeling Barry Jenkins would really dig CITIES OF LAST THINGS. https://t.co/gCe9ryg1QS
Can‚Äôt help but think of FALLEN ANGELS during Dong Ling‚Äôs late-night motorbike ride with Ara (played by Louise Grinberg), a French woman he‚Äôs just met and begins to fall for. https://t.co/hG2kbMM2vy
Wong Kar-wai fans will spot his influence across CITIES OF LAST THINGS, especially in this moment of backseat tenderness (as memorably seen in IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, 2046, and HAPPY TOGETHER). https://t.co/hw9aWhEU7r
To do that, DP Jean-Louis Vialard (TROPICAL MALADY) shot the entire film in 35mm. What results is a stylized mood piece full of stark contrasts where the shadow-lined wet streets and fluorescent-lit police stations are as menacing and alive as the seedy people within them. https://t.co/mtvtvqlc8d
Most notably, Ho doesn‚Äôt differentiate the time periods with different visual styles, but instead maintains a cohesive look across the film. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want it to look like three films. Or an anthology by different directors,‚Äù Ho told @Variety.
Across the three segments, Ho fuses sci-fi with noir, romance, and melodrama. The blend of genres never feels overwhelming or gimmicky since each help to emphasize Dong Ling‚Äôs emotional states of isolation, mistrust, and rage throughout. https://t.co/qFpup4wDiK
CITIES hops back 30 years to the present and then the past to reveal significant events in Dong Ling‚Äôs life, memorably played as a rookie cop by Lee Hong-chi (last seen in LONG DAY‚ÄôS JOURNEY INTO NIGHT) and as a struggling teen by Xie Zhang-ying. https://t.co/uVo9nGUrLB
In the first segment, we meet ex-cop Zhang Dong Ling (Jack Kao) in a wintry futuristic Taipei. Ho‚Äôs neon-drenched dystopia ‚Äî full of police drones, ID surveillance chips, and high-tech beauty serums ‚Äî visually recalls the worlds of MINORITY REPORT and BLADE RUNNER. https://t.co/KXk5sT1HUi
Structurally, CITIES OF LAST THINGS recalls the non-linear narratives of Christopher Nolan‚Äôs MEMENTO and Gaspar No√©‚Äôs IRREVERSIBLE. But Ho‚Äôs film also echoes Hou Hsiao-Hsien‚Äôs masterful 2005 film THREE TIMES, about a trio of love stories across Taiwanese history.
Told in reverse chronological order, CITIES OF LAST THINGS begins in a dystopian future before jumping back in time to understand the deep-seated anguish that‚Äôs sculpted one man‚Äôs decisions, and the origins of a family defined by outbursts of violent masculinity.
The fifth feature from the Malaysian-born, Taiwan-based filmmaker weaves together three time frames ‚Äî the future, present, and past ‚Äî across three nights and three seasons in one man‚Äôs life. https://t.co/fm2xdQmCOV
One movie, multiple genres, three time periods, told in reverse order. That‚Äôs Ho Wi Ding‚Äôs CITIES OF LAST THINGS, an ambitious triptych that melds sci-fi, noir, romance, and drama while evoking beloved films of Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and American cinema. (thread)

‚ÄúThat immediate conflict or contrast in character is catnip for high drama, and when you have two great actors who can chew on that conflict, it‚Äôs a blast to watch.‚Äù
‚Äú...movies that started the trend like Walter Hill‚Äôs 48 HRS. (1982) or continued with the original LETHAL WEAPON (1987), where the drama and comedy come from the coupling of two contrasting characters smashed together for a common goal.‚Äù
And when asked what drew people to the buddy comedy genre, Lynch said, ‚Äú...reading Adam‚Äôs script it was already apparent they were going for a tone akin to the buddy-movies that were so prevalent from the ‚Äò80s‚Ä¶‚Äù https://t.co/SkXablvGoR
‚ÄúI was watching SORCERER (1977) one night and thought ‚Äòwhat if Big D was a big cinema fan?‚Äô I mean, why not right? Everyone loves movies and anyone can be a film nerd.‚Äù
With Abe‚Äôs associate, Big D, he wanted to subvert the character into something a little bit different. ‚ÄúAs originally written, he was cool and intimidating but a little clich√©d‚Äì a character we‚Äôve seen many times in movies like this.‚Äù https://t.co/2dffTW6qhT
And Lynch aimed to do that in his own way as well. ‚ÄúWe worked hard to try to find elements and ideas to subvert the usual tropes in these kinds of films.‚Äù https://t.co/rgD9b5wqyj
‚ÄúEven in those films, which might not have been as well-received originally, you can still feel Friedkin pushing the limits of storytelling.‚Äù
‚ÄúI also loved how he (Friedkin) always felt fiercely independent in his cinematic voice, even when doing ‚Äòone for them‚Äô like JADE (1995), DEAL OF THE CENTURY (1983), or BLUE CHIPS (1994).‚Äù
‚ÄúTO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. (1985) is not just one of my favorite Friedkin films but easily one of my favorite thrillers from any decade. There is a balance of tones and moods that, having lived in LA now for a while, just *feels* like it represents so many flavors of the city." https://t.co/WUnHsBPMWP
‚ÄúFriedkin had a way to build these worlds that live and breath with characters that are morally conflicted, leaving it up to the audience to decide how they perceive heroes and villains.‚Äù https://t.co/R20DeAQaxc
Another major influence to the film was William Friedkin, who‚Äôs directly referenced in the film. ‚ÄúHe has been a hero of mine since I can remember‚Ä¶ he was one of those Hollywood mavericks who always seemed to know which buttons to press and what boundaries to push.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo we watched movies like Ridley Scott‚Äôs AMERICAN GANGSTER (2007), John Frankenheimer‚Äôs RONIN (1998) and even Spielberg‚Äôs DUEL (1971)... And we watched a lot of Brian De Palma‚Äôs BLOW OUT (1981) because‚Ä¶well, it's BLOW OUT and it‚Äôs just visual crack.‚Äù
‚ÄúOur DP, Juanmi Azpiroz, and I would watch movies almost every day in our little makeshift screening room in the office to give the film a style that teetered between the grounded grit of the streets coupled with balances of light and shadows.‚Äù https://t.co/ts0Oi10qxZ
