Incredibly sad what's happened to Zimbabwe cricket. Not being allowed to compete in ICC events while they're suspended - unlike US and Nepal previously - may encourage players to move completely.

72 days after his England debut, Jofra Archer bowls the Super Over as England win the World Cup
Just to make this more sickening for New Zealand - with the old tiebreaker in ODI cricket when games were tied, fewer wickets lost, they would not be World Cup champions
That finish, and in the first day on FTA TV for 14 years - could be a seminal day for English cricket's future
Absolutely sickening for New Zealand. Actually not sure the World Cup needed a Super Over - think a tie such a unique result that the weirdness of joint winners is OK - but thats a debate for another day
For the bin https://t.co/d9W9WpHtSS
One of the greatest of all cricket games.
16 to win from an over against Jofra Archer. Hard to give NZ more than a 1 in 5 chance
Not sure you can rationalise a Super Over, but in theory suits England batsmen more than New Zealand's
This is too much.
Cricket. Bloody hell
Ben Stokes had 19 to defend in the last T20 World Cup final. Now he has 15 to score
Trent Boult will now play the role of Wasim Akram in the 1992 final
If Colin de Grondhomme bowling gentle swingers is not going to get new cricket fans on free-to-air, I don't know what is
If Joe Root can only make 7 off 30 balls, suggests this wicket isn't that easy to bat on

@Edge2slip Thank you!
Captaincy straight out of the Brendon McCullum playbook from Eoin Morgan: rather than save Jofra Archer for the death, bowls him out by the end of the 39th over.
High quality leg spin one end, express pace the other. The classic combination and stuff of England dreams.
Faith in Adil Rashid has been so central to England's success. Kept on for a 5th over after his first 4 overs went for 29, dismisses Alex Carey to end a century 4th wicket stand
Alex Carey, terrific all World Cup at no 7, now out at 14-3. Steve Smith special needed for Australia

As India have picked two spinners, will have to introduce one fairly soon. Batting first might be a better way for New Zealand to negate India's spin attack - India have no real option but to bowl 20 overs of spin
