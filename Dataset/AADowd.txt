@rockmarooned Also, the three albums before Z are all better than the three after it. I'd suggest you check them out on Spotify, but oh yeah...
@Books_Not_Wooks Tbh, nothing after Z excites me much. But EVIL URGES is actively irritating in spots and very long. It's their worst, I think.

I love IN RAINBOWS and am very bored by KING OF LIMBS, but "best" and "worst" seems like a stretch.

Exactly one moment delighted me as much as, well, any moment in SPIDER-VERSE, and it was the first post-credits scene. Have never been so happily surprised to see a character in one of these films.

@DanielGorman20 If memory serves, BLADE TRINITY is the top-grossing movie of all time.
@EricDSnider That's credible.
Ever heard a Jia Zhangke fan tell anyone to "Let people enjoy things"?
Funny how fans of the most popular, culturally dominant pop culture are also the most defensive about what they like. Imagine how they'd feel if they cared about anything remotely underappreciated or unsung.
@DenisCampbellll Right, because the time period is the lone element of STRANGER THINGS that recalls those other works. Just the fact that it's set in the 80s.
@railoftomorrow True, they all sort of feel like alternate cuts of themselves.
@BlGKAHUNA King is doing more than regurgitating the look and feel of those things. Planet-sized difference between being inspired by something and paying slavishly nostalgic tribute to it.
@MovieManifesto Not what I mean by "version." Talking about different cuts of the same movie.
Likewise, while I understand the argument for the "Assembly Cut" of ALIEN 3, it's not the theatrical cut of ALIEN 3, which I already cherish.
For example, I own the deluxe Anchor Bay DVD release of DAWN OF THE DEAD, but can't ever get more than 10 minutes into one of the other cuts before switching back to the theatrical.
One of my movielover quirks is that I find it very hard to warm to alternate versions of a movie I know well and love, even if the alternate version is "better." Any disruption to the rhythm of the movie feels wrong.
