The NDC is a direct offshoot of the NLC that illegally overthrew the only democratically elected government of Ghana.

https://t.co/hwmcxcd4fl
The NLC changed to become NRC, that quickly changed to become SMC 1 and that also changed to become SMC 2, in no time it was AFRC and AFRC became PNDC and that changed later to NDC.
The NDC deliberately combines the UP and NLC in order to hide their own genealogy from the latter.

The reasons and objectives for the NLC’s illegal overthrow of Nkrumah has remained from 1966 to date.
He analyzed and named them in his book: *Dark Days in Ghana* 🇬🇭. According to him the UP was the Civilian wing of the opposition he faced;  the opposition within the Military and Police is what later became known as the NLC.

The call for the liquidation of the 1992 #SakawaConstitution therefore not our call; it is a moral call. Inevitably, the criminal #SakawaConstitution will fall on the strength of its own moral weakness.
Secondly, while it pretends in its claims, under Article 17 (1), that we are all equal before before the law, it indemnifies others, putting them over and above the law, in Article 34 under the Transitional Provisions, in clear breach of universal democratic tenets.
This a constitution that was born by the gun, and it derives its legitimacy from the criminalization of the only constitution that gave Ghana 🇬🇭 its Republican status.
A Constitution, above all else, must have the morality of its own claims. 
Unfortunately, the 1992 constitution doesn’t have that.
