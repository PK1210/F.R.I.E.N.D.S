Terrific knock &amp; excellent effort by @benstokes38, especially given the pressures of the World Cup Final.
Special talent!
#KaneWilliamson continues to impress. Loved the way he played &amp; carried himself &amp; his team right through the #CWC19.

A game that ebbed and flowed from the 1st ball to the 612th! 
Feel for New Zealand 🇳🇿 who did everything that England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 did and still fell short. 
Congratulations to England.

@MervHughes332 Big Merv, I believe Raju just wanted to see you smile 😜 and look, you're still smiling after all these years!
💔 just like every 🇮🇳 supporter.
A good fight put up by @imjadeja &amp; @msdhoni but @BLACKCAPS were exceptional today.
Congrats to 🇳🇿 on making it to the Finals &amp; all the best for the same.
I felt #KaneWilliamson’s captaincy &amp; composure played a crucial role in this result.

Wishing a very happy birthday to an extremely special man, whose passion for the game even to this day is an inspiration for us... just as his batting was!

A great game of cricket, arguably the best of the #CWC19. 
Loved the spirit shown by Afghanistan.
Bumrah &amp; Shami were absolutely amazing &amp; Chahal getting Rashid’s wicket was the difference at the end. Crucial spells by Hardik &amp; Kuldeep.
It was a good test for 🇮🇳.
#INDvAFG https://t.co/dbYJNMQKdt
Brilliant stuff from Sri Lanka.
What they didn't do with the bat, they more than compensated with the ball.
Malinga and Co. were disciplined &amp; troubled the batsmen.
With England still needing to play Australia, New Zealand &amp; India, the #CWC19 may throw up a few surprises.
#ENGvSL https://t.co/T4mHATZiz2
Feel for you Shikhar. You were playing well &amp; to be injured in the middle of such an important tournament is heartbreaking. I’m sure you’ll come back stronger than ever.

Massive total put up thanks to some fantastic batting by @RealShubmanGill, @lynny50 and @Russell12A. However, with a beautiful surface to bat on and a lightning quick outfield, this could turn out to be a very close game. What do you think guys? 😊 #KKRvMI
