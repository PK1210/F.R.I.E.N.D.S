With 300 doctors resigning from their duties in response to the heinous attacks happening against doctors in West Bengal, I fail to understand how the situation is not worthy of a national outrage!
The violence going on against doctors in West Bengal is absolutely unfortunate, disturbing and heart wrenching. What‚Äôs even more unfortunate is how it‚Äôs not a matter of national concern. Why isn‚Äôt the media covering the ongoing menace?! (1/2)
Extoticization of the alarming climate change is pure ignorance and lack of knowledge. The sceneries might be spectacular but the consequences that will follow might not be as amazing. Types of damages that could result from this can be hazardous! @indiatimes https://t.co/jwcJCqN8kz
