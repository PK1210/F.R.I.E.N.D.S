@imshubham76 Hehe nothing like that. It‚Äôs a good 11.
@imshubham76 I get the logic of Jadeja. Fair point but fact is he batted just once so cannot consider him. Also you have Shakib batting at 6 whereas he batted at 3 all tournament. Should ideally match up players to their exact batting spot, minus one place in extreme situations.
@Ayush2khurana @imshubham76 See the impact Roy had. Seven innings, four 50s and a century. Missed three games. More impactful than Warner who in half his innings was very scratchy.
@imshubham76 @sagarcasm Jadeja played just twice and batted once. Surely a tournament XI should recognise widespread success over as many games as possible. Also good to look at performances that get teams into the semis. My changes: Roy for Warner, Neesham for Root at 6, Ferguson for Jadeja.
@aditya_bh16 @cricketworldcup Wait till you wake up tomorrow and stop getting emails titled ‚ÄòSchedule of press conferences, teams‚Äô practice and matches for match xxxx of the ICC Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup‚Äô . Then it really hits you.
@BatutasGluttony @SonalHayat @Naa_Cheese Haha its not the first time, for me. Several people have mentioned it. My son, when two, thought I was Stokes and Bairstow.
Stokes getting four runs when the ball hit his bat as he dived to make his crease was divine intervention. The cricketing equivalent of the Red Sea parting for Moses as he led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt.

@sunil_sachin India's bowling was the best in the tournament. Batting weakness was plain to see. The day Rohit and Kohli failed collectively, India were always going to struggle to win. Had to happen one day.
@Suppppandi 91* trumps everything else. But its because of Rohit and Kohli and Dhawan that India make it so many knockouts.
