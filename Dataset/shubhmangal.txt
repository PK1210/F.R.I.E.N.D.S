@nitin_gadkari sir, FastTag is such a brilliant idea and where ever enforced is very efficient. However, very few toll plaza are enforcing it.i think you should come down hard on such contractors.
"Fails Again" is the key here.What was SC thinking?Just ban don't do conditional banning it never works,we were taught that in school.Stop playing with our life.Time to Act and make the SHOs responsible.#DelhiAirPollution #DelhiPollution #DelhiDoesntCare #DelhiSmog #DelhiChokes https://t.co/H3oLryvGjj

@Secretary_DoT @manojsinhabjp not worthy of your time but would really appreciate if you can have someone look into this issue for us. I have all the proof that Airtel is not serious about our complaint.
@airtelindia  @MIB_India @rsprasad @TRAI @rssharma3 @DoT_India  @GovtOfIndia_ @consaff completely harassed by @Airtel_Presence with no fault of mine.they have suspended my number and it's been 5 days and got no response.pls pls help.
@Airtel_Presence @airtelindia #airtel_ceo #Airtel one full week and number still suspended with no customer agent understands why so or how to fix. They assure to arrange a call back but no body calls.I have DM the above but no respond. @TelecomTalk can u guide us
@Airtel_Presence @nipunmehra You can only be sorry but not act.  i am 14 year old customer and will be loosing me to Jio hopefully tomorrow...From double billing, to no data to suspended number is my journey in last 4 days.
@Airtel_Presence @TRAI ##airtel_ceo #airtelsucks Bravo, just so that i dont get to generate Number portability SMS, my number is now suspended by Airtel? From the issue of double billing, to no data to number being suspended?No response from airtel at all in last 4 days.
@JioCare I have dm the details
@Airtel_Presence Oh look Jio at least responded:

@shubhmangal We will be happy to have you in our Jio family. Request you to DM your contact number, email address, area PIN code, state name and your full name so that we can assist you further
@IndiaTodayTech #Airtel_CEO @airtelindia #Airtel needs to focus on customer service before they even attempt to take on anything? with growing user base they are not able to handle it.
@Airtel_Presence @Airtel_Presence @airtelindia @TelecomTalk #airtel_ceo #Airtel can you guys pls tell me the process to do Number portability from Airtel to Jio? Or may be better yet move to prepaid to get better service from Airtel. They clearly don't seem to care anymore for retaining old cust.
@Airtel_Presence Seriously what the hell are you guys doing now my data on secondary number is turned off? Do you have all fools engineer working for you now?
@Airtel_Presence @airtelindia @TelecomTalk #airtel_ceo #Airtel has figured out a way to con the customers in the name of family plans by creating billing issues which they commit to have resolved but keeps coming back every month. is #jio any better, have to consider it

Samsung S4 heats up when using camera for 5mins,battery last about 9 hrs on normal use on 3G.Rich in features,not worth the price tag.
@RajivMakhni Assuming S4 is priced at 42k, would you still recommend HTCOne?Its a close battle.Never been happy with HTC previous models.

@yashchandy Samsung battery is only getting better with every mobile. See S3 and then Note2.so I m sure S4 shld be good too.lets hope :-)

Advantage of a 16mbps line is that iOS6 upgrade is downloaded in 6 minutes flat.WOW!Only if Airtel cld keep it consistent,i wld stick to it.
@prasanto They are not the cheapest and in today's cut throat market it wont take them to places.Need to redefine business model.
@prasanto I am a regular online buyer.Flipkart sucks in terms of service and pricing.Letsbuy was way better, i wish they didnt get acquired.
@prasanto Thanks. Cheapest place to get electronics i think is the US, and this Tradus deal beats it,I just placed my order.Thank you.
@prasanto @b50 @BawlaBaccha 2TB is no doubt a great price but has an external power source. Not very portable for some.
@midnightsmovie @IamDeepaMehta @SalmanRushdie pls pls release #MidnightsChildren on youtube as pay per view for the deprived audiences
