@NetsNot (2 of 2) - This is an unfortunate and rare incident and we would like to thank the RSPCA and fire services for their help in dealing with the trapped bird.
@NetsNot We use netting to deter pigeons and other birds from roosting and perching on specific areas of our buildings. We do this to prevent mail and other assets from being damaged by bird fouling. (1 of 2)
