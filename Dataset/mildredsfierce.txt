Another #FF goes out to @thehorrorchick. she’s an amazing editor and i’ve loved covering @FantasiaFest fest for her over at @dailydeadnews. more reviews to come, but i can’t wait for the other opportunities in the future i’ll have working with her 👻
i had my first interview in years today and i think it went great! i really enjoyed it which is something i never thought i’d say since interviews are so nerve-racking. and the manager i’d be working with is soo nice it’s definitely an environment i could see myself loving 🥰
@wescravn @thefilmera I liked this earlier but just sat down to give it a read. I didn’t like the film tbh but i love this review!! We make some similar points 💖💙💜

pitch rejections are tough and not receiving a response at all also sucks. I wish i knew what i was doing wrong but im not giving up. i sent another pitch today and im crossing my fingers 🤞🏻
i’ve mainly been pitching to publications that pay because i need the money (i wish this werent the case). publications that like to highlight movies by women, uk film, or publications that like to take pieces written by women.
i haven’t found a publication yet that is willing to let me write a retrospective on CRACKS which is really upsetting to me honestly. it’s jordan scott’s one and only feature film and i feel like no one remembers her or even knows that ridley scott’s daughter directed a movie.

2) is jean-marc vallee why we have no ice cream throwing scene
I can’t believe Vallée and HBO thought it was even ethical to do what they did. Completely erasing a director’s hard work. Andrea Arnold didn’t deserve that. No female director does. This makes me not even want to finish the season.
”A show dominated by some of the most powerful actresses in Hollywood hired a fiercely independent woman director – who was now being forced to watch from the director’s chair as scenes were shot in the style of her male predecessor.” This is devastating https://t.co/uIbOKGs4Wc
