@JD_RFC_TIGER Respect for umpires vital - so is fan passion. Where is the line ?

Sport to me was better when we celebrated goals, efforts, heroes not fought what are largely external society issues each week through our leisure past time.
Fans all sports need to understand tech like flash bails invented for TV viewers benefit not to umpire the game. 

Largely broadcasters pay for tech that gets questioned.

In all codes this needs serious discussion about the purpose and viewers experience
