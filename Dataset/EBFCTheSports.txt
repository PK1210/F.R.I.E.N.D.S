FULL TIME

@Lewes_cfc 3-1 #EBFC

The Sports suffer defeat in their latest pre-season outing which leaves Lee Bradbury with plenty to ponder ahead of next week's game at Burgess Hill

#EBFC #OnTheRoad
87: Romain goes close to halving the deficit after Wheeler tests Collings

#EBFC
Lewes go close to a fourth as Hammond plays a neat ball through to Golding, who lifts the ball over Hadler but it goes over off of the bar

#EBFC
Double change for Borough as Trialist A &amp; B come on for Ferry and Wilson

#EBFC
72: @Lewes_cfc 3-1 #EBFC

A mistake at the back gifts Bown a tap in

#EBFC
70: CLOSE!

West tees one up 25 yards out that is only kept out by the post!

2-1

#EBFC
65: GOAL! @Lewes_cfc 2-1 #EBFC

Nicky Wheeler scores his first goal for the club in style as he curls the ball off of the underside of the bar and in, giving Collings no chance

#EBFC
64: better from the Sports, as Wheeler sends in a low cross but it just about evades everyone in the centre

#EBFC
Lewes 2-0 #EBFC

58: After Borough concede possession in midfield, Golding is given time to drive at the defence and his low strike finds the bottom corner from just inside the area

#EBFC
Borough make a treble change as Luer, Walker and Cox are replaced by Wheeler, West and Romain. Walker unlucky not to win a penalty moments before

#EBFC
We're back underway here at The Dripping Pan with the Sports trailing 1-0

#EBFC
HALF TIME

Mongoy's effort is all that separates the two sides at the break as Lewes lead 1-0

#EBFC
A break in play as Charlie Walker calls "ruck over" as he takes the assistant referee down, with the Sports forward coming off worse... Try again, Charlie

#EBFC
39: A great save from Stroomberg denies Luer from scoring his first goal back at the club, with the keeper doing well to turn a free kick from 20 yards over the bar

#EBFC
Lewes 1-0 #EBFC

The hosts break the deadlock here after 34 minutes as Mongoy diverts a low free kick past the wrong footed Hadler

#EBFC
20 minutes in here and it remains goalless with both teams looking dangerous on the attack - Campbell has seen a free kick saved

#EBFC 0-0
Underway at the Pan, with Lewes going early on

#EBFC
FULL TIME

@MillwallFC U23 run out 2-0 winners here at Priory Lane in an even game, and a good work out for Lee Bradbury's side

Borough now look forward to a trip to @Lewes_cfc on Saturday as preparations for the new season continue. Thanks to @MillwallFC for a good game

#EBFC
84 | Dan Blackmore comes on for the Sports moments before a mix up at the back from Millwall almost leads to a consolation, but Muller recovers to clear off the line

#EBFCvMILL (0-2)
81 | Millwall U23 double their lead as Tiensa breaks down the left before steering a low drive across goal and into the far corner

#EBFCvMILL (0-2)
80 | Borough make a double change with 10 to go as Astle and Chalmer-Stevens replace Tobi and Hadler in goal

#EBFCvMILL (0-1)
77 | Duncan scoops one over the bar after good work from Ezennolim sets him up

#EBFCvMILL (0-1)
68 | Borough threaten to draw level as Wills finds the feet of a Triallist, who turns well but his left footed drive is parried away by Fanshawe

#EBFCvMILL (0-1)
61 | @MillwallFC U23 make five changes during a pause in play, whilst Borough make a double change to follow those made at the break

#EBFCvMILL (0-1)

#EBFCvMILL (0-1)
Back underway here at the Lane, with several changes taking place at the break

#EBFCvMILL (0-0)
HALF TIME

Eastbourne Borough 0-0 Millwall U23

The Sports go into the interval on level terms with @MillwallFC U23 after a competitive half here at Priory Lane

#EBFCvMILL (0-0)
37 | Borough concede possession in their half and Munting has a go, but Halder does well to turn the ball over for a corner

#EBFCvMILL (0-0)
25 | Close for Borough as Walker lays it off to Tobi on the right. He fizzes a low ball into the six yard box which Mitchell can only hook over his own bar

#EBFCvMILL (0-0)
10 | Campbell whips in a free-kick and picks out Jones at the far post, but his diving header is wide

#EBFCvMILL (0-0)
4 | A Triallist has the first effort of the game for the visitors, but it floats just over the bar before Campbell's cross picks out Romain, who can only head over from six yards.

#EBFCvMILL (0-0)
