I cannot counter lies so I’m going to let this go. But you know the truth. Twisting the truth to suit your narrative is not something I will indulge in. Good day and good luck. https://t.co/Zy5aRTpLdP
@ananthmahadevan Keep at it sir. Umeed chod di toh phir hum aage kaise badhenge? 😀
No Rangoli, it is sad that it has come to this. It is sad that an actor the media has loved and championed has been so disrespectful. Nobody has intimidated or threatened the self-made actor. The group has asked the actor to reconsider her words. Surely that’s fair. https://t.co/EqlO6ND6pI
@meghalparekh Try this: https://t.co/DyVlASCeam
The (clearly!) very talented young cast of the new Netflix show Typewriter taking away the job of one “fat guy with salt and pepper hair” 😜 https://t.co/jzOwLOtvsx
Very proud of my colleagues who have come together to form the #EntJournalistsGuild. It’s a good time to introspect, repair, and stand up for what is right. Must set high standards for ourselves, and expect respect in return for respect given.
@MB350 @CNNnews18 https://t.co/guSKpNl9GP
@krishna_ag1203 Have asked a producer to get in touch with you.
@vamsiroiderevez @CNNnews18 You have to ask that to @CNNnews18
@tripu17 Thank you :)
@Chander56578532 That I am. What’s wrong with that though?
@srivelamakanni Thank you :)
@ArunabhRana @aadarshraj @KubbraSait @shahidkapoor Teri maa bahut khush hogi teri sundar zubaan sunkar.
@srivelamakanni I can’t answer that. Only you can. I can only say that I said what I felt.
@aadarshraj @Shyam_grandhi @A_s_h_C_a_r @KubbraSait @shahidkapoor Of course you should decide yourself. Don’t read/watch reviews. Why do you?
@srirangareddy Disturbed me, why?
@Abby_Rulz Hair not beard #justsaying
@adhiwadge https://t.co/guSKpNl9GP
@Shyam_grandhi @A_s_h_C_a_r @KubbraSait @shahidkapoor Tu hi karle review bhai, mujhe sikhane ke bajaye
@putul_rani_deb If I did that what would be the difference between us? Besides I wasn’t offended - he called me fat and said I have salt and pepper hair. Both of which are true, so I dont know why anyone thinks I should be offended. I think he meant them as insults but I dont view it that way :)
@HanuNtrFanz Me too :)
@fu_banda @rdpathan If you don’t mind I’ll decide who I want to reply to.
@imjitenjoshi @gauravkapur Aah ok I will. Thank you for pointing me to it :)
@DrRams85 @A_s_h_C_a_r @KubbraSait @shahidkapoor @imvangasandeep That’s your opinion and I fully respect it. But you’re reading agenda into mine which doesn’t exist. That’s not fair. But no hard feelings. Have a good day.
@DrRams85 @A_s_h_C_a_r @KubbraSait @shahidkapoor You clearly don’t know how to read.
@naniyouthicon @A_s_h_C_a_r @KubbraSait @shahidkapoor And well. Thank you for asking :)
@fu_banda @rdpathan You want me to reply to those that abuse? That’s kind of pointless.
@A_s_h_C_a_r @KubbraSait @shahidkapoor Excuse me. The actor did endorse his director’s views when he encouraged ppl to watch the interview, tweeting - “For all those who would want to know the mind behind #kabirsingh.” You don’t get to play both sides.
@rdpathan Thank you :)
@rishabgautam @CNNnews18 Theres no right or wrong. This isnt mathematics where there is only 1 correct answer to a sum. This is abt emotion, how a film resonates (or doesnt) with you. You - and many others - may love KS. Clearly there are many who found it problematic. Both are entitled to feel that way.
@rishabgautam @CNNnews18 Also ALL films are made with a lot of passion and hard work. Even the ones that turn out to be awful. But that can’t weigh in on a critic while reviewing. One has to review based on how one feels. It’s entirely personal. Don’t agree with a critic, don’t read/watch him. (contd)
@rishabgautam @CNNnews18 The audience is not one person. Best not to generalize. For every person that likes a film, I’ll show you two that don’t. Also a critic’s review is not meant to be a predictor or indicative of what ‘the audience’ has liked, or what works at the box office. (contd)
@jewsondai12 @CNNnews18 No. Fat guy with salt and pepper hair :)
@rishabgautam @CNNnews18 That’s just the beauty of it, you know....there is no right and wrong answer. This is what I felt about the film. Doesn’t match how you felt about it. But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong and you’re right, or vice versa.
@EbbyAbsar Thank you :)
@EbbyAbsar @gauravkapur Popped up on my recommendations list cos I really enjoy Gaurav’s shows, so I decided to watch a few mins. Ended up really loving the whole thing :)
Such a lovely chat, @gauravkapur. I know so little about (and have such little interest in) cricket, and yet I enjoyed every moment of this interview. Had a huge smile throughout. Such warmth and comfort and genuine love for the game both of you shared 👍👍👍 https://t.co/tqPAqYK95K
@Namrata_Joshi 🙈
@rao_n101 And I didn’t. I’m not calling you an idiot bec you loved the film. I’m calling you an idiot bec you couldnt digest a contrary opinion. Now vanish please.
@rao_n101 You’re an idiot, but it takes all types.
@vassusen @CNNnews18 I never said characters like that don’t exist. Also I’m not sure what point you’re trying to make. I’m sorry you had to go through that. I’m sorry someone treated you like that. But I still don’t get your point.
Just before their third season drops this week, I chatted with the breakout stars of #StrangerThings and asked them about the strangest place they’ve seen their faces plastered across https://t.co/o9uzRMCcxf
Before you catch #SpiderManFarFromHome this weekend, listen to @TomHolland1996 tell me what it was like shooting *that* funeral scene with the entire cast of #AvengersEndgame, and why they still don’t share major plot details with him https://t.co/MD1YSTJtmh
@cinema_karan That’s a good question. I think Academy admission rules require that to qualify, you have to be a member of your respective guild (Directors/Writers/Actors Guild of America), and that your film/s should have been released in Los Angeles County for a certain number of days/wks.

@41unhsiv @PedestrianPoet You’re an idiot. Have a good day.
@knlkale Actually a review IS meant to be a critic’s personal opinion :)
@archpats @CNNnews18 If you’re going to tell me how to review a film, then why don’t you do it? Also I didn’t say what the actor should do. Ask someone who understands English to read the review to you again, granny.
@a4aniruddhadey @CNNnews18 Thank you for interpreting my job the way you see it. If you don’t mind, I’ll do it the way I see it.
@DexterMorgan699 I’m looking at your DP and thinking, of course you’d have this reaction to this film. They know their audience. Goodnight idiot.
@RahulChowhannn We get the idiots we deserve, we get the cinema we deserve.
@mukulbhartiya @textpecting @Advani_Kiara @shahidkapoor @TSeries @sureshoberoi @taran_adarsh Actually I said neither of those things abt those movies. So when you’re criticizing someone at least do you homework, jackass.

@arallan78 Again you give yourself too much importance - not offended at all.

@singlechhora @arallan78 Commie, left liberal, right winger. You only have to know me to know I have ZERO political leaning or frankly understanding even. Anyone who knows me will tell you. But if you already have an agenda, I suppose it suits your agenda to make up these theories. Lage raho vaibhav bhai
@MMayank05 @chillshaily Bhai koi arrogance nahin. Lekin koi badtameezi se baat kare toh hume bhi woh bhaasha aati hai :)
@IndiaWalaStewie Will ask you when I want your opinion.
@arallan78 Also you’re right. Reviewing films IS my prerogative. So quit shoving your agenda down my throat. Have a nice day by the way :)
@arallan78 Not offended; amused by your haste to sniff a conspiracy where there isn’t one. When I miss a film it’s usually bec I’m traveling. And I don’t pick my travel dates based on the box office potential of the films releasing that week. So it’s still a stupid argument that you make.
@chicha_bpl Uss film ko 7 out of 5 stars diye. Yeh raha uska review: https://t.co/aimWpCPaCd Bhagwan ne aakhen di hain, button nahin. Kabhi istmaal kiya karo. Burai karne ke pehle, check toh kar lo. Warna gadhe lagte ho. Jaise ab lag rahe ho :)
@arallan78 Also Blank, RAW, Notebook, and Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai. Your point is what exactly..?
@chillshaily Aapka DP aur aapka Twitter naam sahi sahi jamta hai :)

@ashokepandit @vivekagnihotri Dear Mr Pandit. I expect better from you. Cant speak for my colleagues, but Ive repeated this a few times - I was traveling overseas and missed all films that released that week. So this conspiracy theory is pointless, unless it serves a convenient agenda. Happy birthday.
