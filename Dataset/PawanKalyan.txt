General body is in their final discussion from which two constituencies , I should be contesting.
Hopefully,they will let me know in an hour or later.
In a while I will be coming on Facebook live
After a diligent process, the General body of our Party has finalised the first list of Candidates for 32 Assembly and 9 Parliamentary Constituencies.
For all this stories to stop ‚Äò what they expect me to do is; to support these parties but not be independent.May be ,I am a small pawn in the game of political chess; but established political classes  should remember ‚Äò I am a soldier ‚Äô who‚Äôs is willing to fight.
I want people to prepare for more stories as the election dates come nearer.
But I am inspired by the path of Late ‚ÄòSri Kanshi Ram‚Äô establishing BSP  without any channel and news paper. My Janasainiks are my channels and news papers.
One senior Political observer told  me that,both ‚ÄòTDP &amp; YCP joined hands   to damage the reputation of JSP by constantly planting stories.
I wish I could have my paper and TV channel to fight back.
TDP says JSP is a partner to YCP and BJP ; Now YCP says JSP is  a partner to TDP. When I meet Sri KCR in Rajbhavan TDP says I am with YCP &amp; TRS. When you truly work for people you have to face music from all sides.üòä
I thank you a lot @KatherineHadda for patiently hearing our concerns about our students and on immigration issues. And also, I truly appreciate your efforts to curb human trafficking of helpless and vulnerable women in India. Our support will be always there for such programs. https://t.co/Ij7mzsNRZu
Recently; when I happen to meet him,after few hours of exchange of ideas,I felt his insightful &amp; expert guidance on many issues to a nascent party like ‚ÄòJSP‚Äô is very essential. I shared the same &amp; convinced him to come into the party. I am looking forward to welcome him.

The problem in ‚ÄòAP‚Äô is especially; most of the electronic media is all yours, so you control whether news of JSP should go out or not. And it‚Äôs natural you didn‚Äôt let the news comes out , so that you can malign us in public.
https://t.co/h2ZndJ9aLI Sri CBN garu, it. And to my notice that yesterday you have said that ‚ÄòPawan Kalyan‚Äô didn‚Äôt even write to Centre regarding ‚ÄòTitli‚Äô cyclone devastation. Here‚Äôs the proof. https://t.co/KFrnx4I0MU

JSP is against Bauxite mining; in the following video you could see the illegal mining exploitation in a reserved forest. https://t.co/J2IgMZSZKG
Instead of stopping illegal  mining Sri CBN &amp; Sri Lokesh continues to encourage. How come Sri YS Jagan is tight lipped about Bauxite mining. Is he pro or anti- bauxite mining?
Everything happens in vanthada bauaxite mining area; where both opposition &amp; ruling Parties came together in plundering Mother Earth.
Illegal bauxite mining in the name of laterite is banned in reserved forests.These mountains act as natural sponge to absorb water ,will increase ground water level &amp; maintains ecological balance.
There is enough for human need, but not enough for human greed.

The Irony ‚Äò  is even after the sixth day as we visited,half the villages are still under darkness, ‚Äò Dear Respected ChiefMinister,please show them the light in the hour of darkness‚Äô.
In Srikakulam while Titli cyclone effected families outpouring their grief;AP Govt Launches an App ‚Äòurging people to upload the photos with GEO tagging for the damage caused to them..
I don‚Äôt want to be a hindrance with my Visit to Cylone effected areas while Govt machinery initiated relief efforts &amp; ‚Äòcause of this I delayed my visit not because of Kavathu. TDP leaders should show some restraint while they criticise us.
To ‚ÄòTDP leaders‚Äô  You will be accountable for every meaningless criticism on us in future. Measure your words..Nothing goes un noticed.
I request TDP leaders that JSP is a responsible political party and stop criticising our field visits &amp; dont forget we played a instrumental role  in TDP‚Äôs win.
I will keep updating on my Twitter about ‚ÄòThithili cyclone damage‚Äô with photos and videos  while I travel. The world doesn‚Äôt know the extensive damage it caused.

Demand political accountability.
His sacrifice should not be futile or fruitless, due to slothful and irresponsible politicians.  Each one must demand from their political representatives actions which they promised and not allow them to languish sluggishly in their idle self-importance.
I salute Prof Agarwal for his relentless pursuit of a clean Ganga. How must he have suffered for this great cause ? If this does not touch our conscience, nothing will.
Let us solemnly mark Prof Agarwal' s sacrifice as a reminder of our duty to cleanse the Ganga and also hold those accountable for making promises and ignoring them.
Not only the Ganga must be cleansed but also our politics. Where are the politicians who made their promises for the Ganga prakshaalan?  Where is political accountability?
Prof Agarwal 's sacrifice should slice our conscience.If we cannot save our rivers or our heroes even after they fast for 111 days, we need to ask ourselves who it is that will take accountability for such a supreme sacrifice?Why should a man of such nobility give up his life ?
IIT'an Prof. G D Agarwal, 87, has fasted for a clean Ganga and sacrificed his life after 111 days. He died with the final hope that, 'only my death can save the Ganga'. https://t.co/ISIQ9YPfQ4

The younger generation &amp; the General AP public had gone through enough humiliation &amp; loss of economic, educational &amp; industrial backwardness due to Haphazard bifurcation &amp; TDP leadership should behave more responsibly towards people of AP.

At every stage TDP had colluded &amp; compromised with BJP leadership on SCS. Now what they are doing is eye wash &amp; political theatrics for public consumption.
TDP has compromised on special category status for party &amp; personal gains. They had lost trust of people.

TDP‚Äôs argument is very weak &amp; feeble  in parliament session today.I feel they lacked the necessary moral fibre to take SCS demand forward as they had opposed, weakened &amp; diluted the SCS ‚Äòcause of their special package acceptance earlier.
BJP &amp; TDP had wasted a great opportunity given to them by people of AP. They could have truly stood by people instead of this political theatrics,which is causing great deal of public‚Äôs valuable time ,money &amp; agony.

BJP‚Äôs anger on TDP leadership shouldn‚Äôt be the reason to deny SCS to the people of AP.
I join the  people of Andhra Pradesh in urging the BJP led Govt.of India to respond positively for the SCS. No greater Platform than Parliament to understand and empathise with this  Right  of ours. Please deliver Justice
