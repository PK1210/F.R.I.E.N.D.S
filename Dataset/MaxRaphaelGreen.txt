13/ More on Allen's story here: In 2015, after 30+ years in prison, he was approved for release. But even without a conviction Allen must register as a sex offender.  So, he's locked up until he can find a place go that meets the registry requirements. https://t.co/p3uNu1SzTs
12/ Nationwide it amounts to hundreds of people who haven't had criminal trials‚Äîand haven't been convicted of their alleged crimes‚Äîliving indefinitely in prisons or prison-like environments. More on how this works in @ari_tolman's comprehensive paper: https://t.co/riPzzDklbP
11/ Only 3 states‚ÄîIllinois, Massachusetts, and North Dakota‚Äîand the fed. gov't have laws that allow people found to be "sexually dangerous" to be committed to treatment programs in prisons. A few more allow this type of detainment in secure hospitals or treatment facilities.
10/ Today 171 men are locked up under the law at a correctional center in southern Ill. A nonpartisan prison monitoring report says the program is understaffed, underfunded, and may not be equipped to adequately treat the men there‚Äîmany have intellectual and learning disabilities
9/ Now Illinois lawmakers on key committees in the House say the SDP Act warrants a second look, saying "it seems to fly in the face of justice" and the law "should be taken off of the books," echoing the positions of groups like the @ACLUofIL, @RJ_Illinois, and @JHAofIllinois
8/ A governor-appointed commission looked at the law 30+ years ago, concluding it was outdated &amp; should be abolished. Experts told us the same thing, but said legislators lack the political will to do anything that could be seen as sympathetic toward people accused of sex crimes.
7/ A retired prosecutor who did a number of SDP Act cases told us the law can be used to get de facto prison terms that are longer than what a defendant might receive if found guilty in a criminal trial. Had Allen been tried and convicted he likely would've been out in few years.
6/ Allen's case went to the US Supreme Court in 1986 around the question of whether he should have the same protections as a criminal defendant because even w/o a trial, he wound up in a prison. The Court sided with Illinois because the state's intention is to treat, not punish.
5/ But Allen didn't know the treatment program was inside of a prison, where he'd live like any other inmate... or that he'd still be locked up today, 36 years later, without a conviction or criminal trial. Illinois prosecutors call this process "an alternative to a conviction."
4/ We focused on the story of a man named Terry Allen, who was accused of a sexual assault in 1982. Allen had no criminal history of sex crimes and says he went along with prosecutors' plan for treatment, rather than a criminal trial, because he was scared of a prison sentence.
3/ However, today that treatment is administered in an Illinois prison, and some people are stuck in the program for many decades. We crunched the numbers and found on average, people are locked up for 17 years in the program, which mostly consists of group talk therapy sessions.
2/ The 1930s-era Sexually Dangerous Persons Act, or SDP Act, is meant to offer an alternative to prison for people thought to exhibit criminal sexual behavior due to ‚Äúmental disorders,‚Äù briefly committing them to a therapeutic environment and releasing them once they‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù
1/ After a @WBEZ &amp; @frontlinepbs investigation, Illinois legislators say a state law that allows alleged sex offenders to be incarcerated indefinitely‚Äîwithout criminal trials, convictions, or sentences‚Äîshould be changed, or even repealed. #twill  https://t.co/vb25CfJcjl

5/ The company responsible for cleaning up the #coalash proposed stabilizing the riverbank to reduce the chances of a breach. Howard Learner with @ELPCenter said that's at most a stopgap‚Äîthe only real solution is to get the coal ash away from the river. https://t.co/tfNYstlofO
@Tori_Bedford @susanzalkind true story, i was upset
@Earthjustice attorney Jenny Cassel said Illinois has more coal ash pits than any other state: "We're sort of at the epicenter of the coal ash problem...Until one of our branches of government takes action to stop it, Illinois residents and our waters are paying the cost." #twill
4/ Advocates, like aquatic ecologist Lan Richart, with @EJCollaborative told @WBEZ it's an accident waiting to happen. A bad storm or flood could cause a breach in the riverbank, dumping the coal ash into the water: an environmental disaster that could cost billions to clean up.
3/ The toxic metals are leaching into groundwater from 3 large pits on the banks of the river‚Äîon the grounds of a retired power plant. The more than three million cubic yards of the substance contains toxic metals, and the riverbank holding back the ash is slowly eroding.
2/ I went to see the pollution on the Middle Fork, a federally designated Wild &amp; Scenic stretch of Illinois Little Vermilion River, first hand last summer with @PhotosBySebas . The contaminated groundwater seeping into the river was clearly visible from our kayak. https://t.co/Ep17SOFlgz
