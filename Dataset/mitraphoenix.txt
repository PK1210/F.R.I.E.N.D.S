Kublai Khan also started JV system with merchants. Govt provided ships, merchants ran the business. 7:3 profit division ratio. In 1285 he invested 100,000 silver dings for ship building. Merchants could also avail loans with 3-4% interest pm
As early as in 1280s, Kublai Khan's govt had established a 'Porcelain Bureau'. It's job was to regulate number n production capacity of kilns. China already had an organized porcelain industry wit div of labor, joint ventures, n dedicated shipping services for export #Wow
