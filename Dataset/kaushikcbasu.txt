Statesmen know what goons don’t, that when people in a nation, for reasons of race, religion, geography, don’t feel a national identity, the key is to include them &amp; win them over. By threatening them you can get them to mimic affilitation, not feel it, &amp; that weakens the nation.

About your group identity, be it national, religious or language, the right attitude is to feel not proud but good. Instead of feeling proud to be American or Indian or Japanese, which has an element of disparagement of others it’s much better to feel good about whatever you are.

When one pauses to think it’s amazing how much the world has changed.
Barely two decades ago, when someone said “Amazon”, we thought of the river; 
we folded trousers differently;
and only thieves when leaving with the loot would be heard saying, “Don’t forget to take the phone.”
Here is a behavioral economics hypothesis worth testing. If you invite people for dinner at 8.05 pm instead of 8.00 pm not only will they be more punctual but will probably arrive earlier.

Morality is making personal sacrifice for those in greater need and doing good as an end in itself. The right-wing recommendation of ostentatious religiosity and making sacrifices in order to go to heaven is not morality. It is called cost-benefit analysis.
62% chose the bridge, 15% the pond, the rest were scattered. So effectively the ‘focal point’ was the bridge. In my game theory class roughly 85% choose the bridge. https://t.co/qP7KxsQJlS
You &amp; another soldier have been dropped separately on enemy territory, as shown. Each has to choose a place to go to for the other. If both choose the same place they meet &amp; survive. Otherwise not. Where will you go? Amazingly, 6 out of 7 choose the same place. Tweet your answer. https://t.co/6M7glsOfzh

“For an economist to speak about morality is treated as not being hard-nosed. But we do not, &amp; must not, live by wealth and money alone. To uphold basic moral &amp; human ideals is important not just for the individual but for the nation.” My latest OpEd: https://t.co/PVXU4BQz1J

What makes economics special is that among those who write on economics, some are superb, scientific minds and some are lemons, and for non-economists it is difficult to tell who are the lemons.
Delighted by the news of Joko Widodo's victory. Augurs well for Indonesia and for entire Southeast Asia.
