@frostatmidnite Sorry. You’re right. :)
@ajay_panasa It is proven data. I have even given you evidence. I am absolutely fine Mr Ajay. 
And please learn the difference between the noun and the verb and how to use them in a sentence. :)

@kailash1adithya Sadly Nakkeeran didnt send their video team to shoot a video when Mr Vairamuthu molested me. So sorry about that.
Everyone using the FaceApp - Enjoy. https://t.co/D1rd1OBgg9
@kailash1adithya Right. I filed a complaint. Go ahead and file a complaint and I ll come for investigation. Since idiots like you don’t understand how the law works let us start. If you dare go file a case that I harassed you. Go.
@ajay_panasa More importantly do read up how many men took credit for discoveries by women in all the fields you mentioned and remained in power by deceit. That’s not power. A good portion of them haven’t earned it. 

Read Invisible Women - Data Bias against women if you really want to learn

@srini8886 @g_vinay15 @ursyathi I see! So you find situations where you justify hitting your wife / kids. No wonder you have a problem agreeing that a crime is a crime.
@srini8886 :) 
Anyway the fact that you even need to be told to not hit a child and you think you need to hear it ONLY from a parent…. sad
@peruvoddu @srini8886 Actually men in my family have helped cut vegetables, cook. All of that :) My grandfather did it till he was 89. :)

It is unbelievable how an entire factory is actively rehabilitating Mr Vairamuthu’s image in Tamilnadu.

https://t.co/HFL4g9dpb9

https://t.co/DmPqTyzYwx
@kalyan_proud This is a real Issue.
Because men don’t contribute at home, they keep women out of the workforce.

It is just not an issue for YOU. That’s all 😄😄😄😄

@kalyan_proud @peddabbay You are an exception. Not the norm. And the very fact that a major detergent brand had to say this is clear how the majority men are raised
@kalyan_proud @peddabbay https://t.co/U5pyof5f95

I say what I say backed by data. It is the majority. Thanks
@g_vinay15 And here is just one of the reports that men dont do much :)

https://t.co/U5pyof5f95
@g_vinay15 The reason and logic behind the ad is data. That men don’t contribute to housework. That’s all.
@g_vinay15 Yes. When they live alone, men do it.
Let me know when they ALL do it at home and are expected to do it as much as women are and that day I ll stop generalizing.
@AGirlOfHerWords Really? Where’d you read this?
@kalyan_proud Feminism is dangerous like terrorism? Hmm? How? How many countries have been bombed and how many wars waged? 
Please let me know how you decide what is ‘fake’ and real ‘feminism’.
@kalyan_proud @peddabbay Thats amazing. By the way this is in your own home with your family or outside? Just curious :)

And yes, do make sure you dont use this detergent either, OK?

https://t.co/2icCa42qfC
@peddabbay Boycott this brand too? Because they said the exact same thing.
https://t.co/2icCa42qfC
@g_vinay15 I’d have appreciated it if you had condemned him as well. BTW men like him heroes to memes and trolls and they get cheered by the toxic men of society. 
What I said is true.
Men arent raised to help in the house :) Which is why a detergent brand makes this
https://t.co/2icCa42qfC
@peddabbay I’ll wait for a response. Extremist indeed 😂
You can also respond honestly, cross your heart and tell me how much you have done :)
@Mohan36 Yaaas
Somewhere in the world parents are beating their kids toys to make their kids eat out of fear. And they are also called out, thankfully.

@g_vinay15 @ursyathi @srini8886 Well. Considering a random man told me that I should have a kid and then comment on parenting. Become a cricketer and then comment on cricket maybe 😂
@Jason86515065 Really? Let me know how many women own property vs men
@sowmitrik @srini8886 Ok. 
Do you
1. Wash the plate you eat. 2. Clean your own toilet. 3. If you have a kid help in feeding the child at least once a day and not outsource to your parent. 4. Do at least one household chore everyday? 
Am happy to learn and stand corrected.
@igtamil This headline is unnecessary. It is unbelievable and pathetic that you came with something like this for a pregnancy announcement. Or do you do this so that you can irritate people and get clicks?

@srini8886 And this is like saying critics should first make a movie before talking about films. 
Some things are just common sense. 

Don’t give you kid 2-3 debbalu to make him eat. That is all there is.
@Mounikaananthul @mahesh_gani Hahahaha you have no idea how many men are justifying hitting the kids. Goes to show how many have been beaten by their parents and have normalised it.
@nagasaitej :)
@srini8886 These are basics most girls know because we are trained to help out with kids.

@hydbadibc People resorting to slapping the child is still wrong. If you are unable to figure why the child has issues, go to a psychologist. More often than not, the child is absorbing problems that the parents have.
@hydbadibc I am glad. But what you are ‘proud’
Of is normal for women. We all do it from the time we are teens for other people’s kids in our family friends circle :) 
You aren’t inculcated into like women are.
