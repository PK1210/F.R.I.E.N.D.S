@harishkayan @Itskeerthi2k Doubt he will even bother...
@sushilrTOI Sad, but true! But why should the crew suffer? Why no action taken against such unethical work scenario.... that talks about Crores
@PranitaRavi Haha, sadly no. He is travelling the world with our money that he has to pay! Absconding. Wondering if I had gone absconding when an important costume was required? ü§î ETHICS ARE GONE TO THE DOGS üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@PJukalker @archa_mehta @ashwinmawle @shweta_malpani @shravyavarma @nithisha_s Absolutely. Unprofessional and CHEAP. UNETHICAL. Why would anyone want to work at TFI after this? No one should work for free! I‚Äôm happy to be back in Bombay, where ppl stick to their word, and professionalism.
@Dudeabides01 Exactly the assistant directors &amp; editors who are the pillars of the film... when it comes to their pay... they never get paid! Even in this project same case, if I haven‚Äôt got as HOD .. you can Imagine their case.
@harishkayan At the moment I don‚Äôt care for anything but getting my payment. It‚Äôs disgusting behaviour. Lessons learnt!
@archa_mehta @PJukalker @ashwinmawle @shweta_malpani @shravyavarma @nithisha_s 

ever experienced this?
Why do some TFI producers not pay the crew who have worked hard on their project? A film I worked on released last year, but I am still waiting for my pay. It‚Äôs such a sad state. The producer has no professionalism to even reply. Why? When work needs to be done, do I not reply?

The day you can actually help a person feel better, is when you can stop thinking it‚Äôs about you, and make it about the other person (for a change). Maybe understand *why and how* you may have gone wrong instead, to help yourself as well. You‚Äôre welcome.
