@smadygo @ArchanaAshok7 @tmkrishna Blessings to you. It's totally fine to hold that belief of No God. Its your personal choice. But the topic has way deviated from the actual conversation thus nothing much to say. Let's discuss how to eradicate these separative beliefs that are harming harmony &amp; equality. 🙏🏼

@smadygo @ArchanaAshok7 @tmkrishna Who spoke of any book. All I said was these notions like the one we are talking about the issue of the menstrual cycle being impure are man made and thrusted in society eons back. And we need to reform these &amp; step out of all  dogmatic thinking irrespective of where it belongs.
@smadygo @ArchanaAshok7 @tmkrishna No all these notions are man made. Whichever period of time and age across ages doesn't matter. What matters is they are falsely attributed on God and imposed on humanity is what I meant. 🙏🏼
Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary A big #shoutout of #gratitude to all loving souls on Twitter who are a part of my profile... Do share any thing on life or spirituality that you'd like to hear from me. 🙏🏼 Blessings and Namaste to all. https://t.co/vmDsjf8qR5
@smadygo @ArchanaAshok7 @tmkrishna God is Real. These notions are Not. As you rightly said they are all man made. the only way to get civilization to implement them was to put it under fear of God. And not just this several things have been like bullets shot through God's shoulders. May we be blessed with wisdom.

@KiranManral @tmkrishna @kiranmartis9 @Jeroninio If collective humanity starts having more discretion/common sense we won't allow any such person to make us slaves to ignorance. And if we don't rise to the occasion to silent every aspect of negative forces, "ignorance" being one of them, we shall doom ourselves. Wisdom to all🙏🏼
@KiranManral @tmkrishna @kiranmartis9 @Jeroninio "certain condition" saying menstrual cycle is a Sin I guess. Also without which no life would be born. But God maybe never told him that &amp; it wasn't written in any books too 🤔📘 we are our own blocks &amp; axes to cut our feet...
@ArchanaAshok7 @tmkrishna God never told him anything about that... And it wasn't written in any books too 🤔📘 so how can you expect it... If collective humanity starts having more discretion/common sense we won't allow any such person to make us slaves to ignorance. Wisdom be unto all 🙏🏼
@MonaAmbegaonkar @tmkrishna @jalajboy Brother @Jeroninio do share something to this much needed thread. 🙏🏼
@KiranManral @tmkrishna @kiranmartis9 Saw full video. Cleverly he didn't answer the woman &amp; yet gave arbitrary sketchy reply. Our individual/collective common sense &amp; discretion both have become "Swaha/RIPerpetual ignorance" It's sad how even educated fellow beings fall for it all. Wisdom to all. @Jeroninio what say?
#public has to stand up to #voice this rampant ways any large company works. You can't take the customer for granted and squeeze us of our hard earned money.

And you've charged me Wait time when there wasn't any wait whatsoever done by the Driver.
The fare when booked was 143 - 178 which is way below the amount of Rs. 567.04 that is charged to me. There wasn't much traffic and we had not much difficulty and yet you charge me almost 300% surcharge and other amounts? Stop fleecing the customers &amp; please return my balance.
@UberINSupport @Uber_India Please stop fleecing customers 🙏🏼Firstly give option to write our issue right in the beginning as your options dont match. I had to click on some option and ended up with half baked resolve. My fare has been unjustly charged to me. Cont'd https://t.co/YF8f4BzXCg

@SheThePeopleTV The aspect is, the movie is a super Hit and who makes it a super Hit? The Public. And when that happens the maker justifies by such ignorant statements as he feels this is what the Public likes to see... Our #individualsociospiritualresponsibility as a Human Being needs to awaken
@SheThePeopleTV @yamini_pb If the film in its character really demands it, then reprimand of the same should be shown &amp; just like smoking a disclaimer line saying "Please do not copy this. This kind of behavior is punishable / unbailable under the court of law" or whatever the right words could be.
@SheThePeopleTV @yamini_pb Any kind of media be it films, net, advtg need serious reforms on social issues &amp; need a certain aspect of responsibility / disclaimers rather than saying "its not true love if there's no slapping."
We have to stop adulation &amp; romanticizing regressive/violent/abusive behavior 🙏🏼

@SheThePeopleTV @yamini_pb @elsamariedsilva im home hunting as my lease is getting over and had about 5 to 6 refusals based on single status as sad unhealed minds think marriage is a stamp and seal for not doing any wrong. May there be wisdom which seems to be lost in transition somewhere for most 🤔
@SheThePeopleTV @yamini_pb Not only that. Single parent or girl is also refused for renting a home. And no laws apply as individual choice of owner, Building or society becomes applicable. I wonder then where can all singles live? &amp; where can single parents kids study? Maybe the ones who refuse may know 🙃

To do family programs, corporate programs &amp; allow women community &amp; mentoring groups, to be created. We all experience both kinds, so let's showcase the good ones.
@SheThePeopleTV @shailichopra @CIIEvents @FollowCII It's a very scary thin line to call it a myth, because then we are in a dangerous zone of nonacceptance of a blaring reality that does exist thanks to patriarchy &amp; other reasons. To say it doesn't exist is like a patient who can't be treated as he refuses to accept his condition.

@SheThePeopleTV @AngellicAribam We all need sisterhood. These notions have been a blaring reality for lifetimes. We have to nip them in the bud.

@manjiriprabhu True. But try we have to for ourselves. As forgiveness is a gift to ourselves. ☀️
@manjiriprabhu There are lessons in both. The 2nd one has less chances of learning the inner lesson as most often the hurt and unforgiveness stays for lifetime unless the person comes to a point of healing the wounds. ☀️ #roshanishenazz
https://t.co/dmxjMAwxnE - Hello Light Beings, A very Blessed Mother's Day to you All.
Tomorrow is our Last day of Registration for:
Angel Soul Therapy Practitioner Level 1 Training Program in MUMBAI on:▶️ 17th 18th 19th May
Fri-Sun 10 -7 pm

We have been enslaved for lifetimes by dividing us, instigating us against each other, blinding us with the wool of  falsehood in the garb of goodness &amp; eating us within not slowly, but rapidly &amp; steadily. Stop lending your ears to falsehood. See the underlying truth &amp; stand up.
As said by the Great #martinlutherking “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” And this is because #weareallone
Let's stop being blinded by false statements &amp; propaganda &amp; make little efforts to see the truth hidden since decades &amp; centuries. When a truth is uncovered doesn't mean it happened yesterday. Let's gift our world our diligence to go to the roots of all that has been eating us.
When #termites do their job, we never come to know until most damage is done &amp; we see our dear good assets turned into a heap of powder. This applies at all levels - our #innerworld, #society, #politics &amp; all aspects of #life. Check where all it exists &amp; get rid of it NOW.☀RS

@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva @Airtel_Presence Why am I still getting bills from #tatadocomo and also paid 374 April and May when my porting was done on 28th March and new bill is under 299 Airtel plan?
Why is #tatadocomo still sending me unpaid dues smses  &amp; physical bills.
@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva #tatadocomo I want to know why my payments are not updated in past, why you all have not refunded to me my extra Rs. 412 you  took in March
Why is my 374 payment done in April not yet showing at your end or Airtel? Who's got that money out of you two companies?
@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva Why is #tatadocomo Sending bills still... Airtel has not sent me any bill. For April/ May yet I've paid both month bills to Airtel. Why are customers told lies  tatadocomo has shut down &amp; sold off to Airtel if Yes Y is #tata sending bills /smses &amp; who's getting the money paid https://t.co/6kQCWOpMei
@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva @Airtel_Presence and @tatadocomo
I paid airtel
374 in April and 3rd May instead of my 299 plan I haven't got any bills from you nor conformation of excess amount. And plus hounded by #tatadocomo to pay them too. And now you tell me it's my problem to solve with them?
@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva @airtelindia @Airtel_Presence You have to sort this. Why should customers suffer due to take over of companies. @tatadocomo is fleecing money even after being paid and after shutting down sending bills smses hounding customers to pay. 
And Aietel cannot say it's not their problem
@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva @Airtel_Presence @Airtel_Presence You need to write to #tatadocomo &amp; get this sorted. Please get them to stop sending me bills/sms
Get my extra amts
412 full pd 2nd march &amp; repd on 28th March
374 instead of 299 plan paid in April 
374 instead of 299 plan paid in May
Adjusted &amp; credited to me.
@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva Please check DM.
For eons we have been filled with what is told/instigated to us. This is the very reason we have been the only country invaded most times. We can either remain blind as we did for centuries or decide to remove the blindfold &amp; live a life of responsibility with awareness. ☀️RS

@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva And the 374 bill amount is received by Airtel yet #tatadocomo keeps sending me messages of unpaid dues. Same thing you all did and I had to pay double amount for Rs. 412 in March.
@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva I have Rs. 412 that #tatadocomo has wrongly taken extra from me.. My number is ported yet you all keep sending sms and bills.
I can't keep writing several times to your ID which I don't even know who looks as you've shut shop. @Airtel_Presence please respond to Tara Docomo
It's great @iHrithik when inspirational actors like you contribute to the awareness of such important responsibilities in our world. We need more such support on many matters to educate &amp; influence #society. Each of us should live our #individualsociospiritualresponsibility 🙏🏼 https://t.co/vwyHMJ82Mb
@tatadocomo @TataDocomotseva Please explain the above.
@Airtel_Presence Hi i have a Tata Docomo number that has been ported to Airtel. I've made a payment of the same 374 on 3rd May
Yet I get smses from Tata saying that amount is pending. And why is TD still sending me bills and smses? What's going on please tell. Check my DM pls. 🙏🏼

Unhealed souls daily kill goodness, humanity, love &amp; oneness through their mindless blabber. Centuries later we still get brainwashed as a collective lot. Only God can save us &amp; help us with wisdom to resurrect in love. Let's pull the wool off our eyes &amp; see our #RightToTruth

Why should something like this not be brought out to the citizens of the country way early &amp; if that was so, then how has the contesting/rallying for the elections even allowed.. RTI is not just when we ask but to be given to the citizens in right time to make informed decisions. https://t.co/7rtmSXyPYh

So if you have gone &amp; voted as always or even for the first time, then feel very proud of yourself for living up to your responsibilities. But don't think we did any favor to our country by doing so. Remember, people &amp; events will do what they do. We have to see if &amp;.. Cont'd

We are torn naked as each thread is falling apart from the fabric of our existence. Thread feels it is the complete fabric. Centuries gone we yet don't realise this folly allowing vested interests to tear our soul's fabric &amp; crush the shreds in their greed's grinder. #elections
@urbanclap professional cancels an appointment last minute &amp; without checking with customer your automated service reschedules it. With all these supposed big companies, looking after customer's convenience is such a last priority. And refunds here take a week. Hoping will get it
#TashkentFiles A must watch for every #Indian - #LALBAHADURSHASTRI ji's death #truth until served justice will remain one of the #disgraceful chapters of our country's #history Him being born on 2nd Oct, but as good as not known, saddened me for years. May love &amp; justice prevail.
@vivekagnihotri I just tweeted miniscule out of what my heart truly felt seeing your film dear Vivek. God bless you and all involved in this piece of honour 🙏🏼
most of our world History was a His-Story scripted by selected people &amp; pushed down through books to the masses. This film is 1 of the several shockingly sad events of our country &amp; justice is like a despondent hope irony. You've done great service by opening the bag of worms 🙏🏼
@vivekagnihotri it is an unbelievable feat that you've carried out. A heartful Thanks &amp; Congrats to you for the courage &amp; inspiration to make this film. I feel you must get a special print later &amp; show it at colleges/institutions. I loved history till I realised.. Cont'd... https://t.co/Bzg0lLPCPb
@vivekagnihotri Watching it tonight finally... Been waiting for it all this while &amp; happy that #PVR got it in the prime time show timings rather than the unfair timings that were earlier there.. I'm sure it's going to be a bigger people's hit all the way Vivek 👍🏼
