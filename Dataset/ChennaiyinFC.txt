Goal by Minerva. Samuel Lalmuanpuia beats Karanjit with a solo effort to the bottom right corner. 

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
Thapa has been at the heart of every attack so far. Will he score today? 🤔

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
Minerva with a free kick early in the second half but the wall does it's job for us. 💪

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
The second half is underway in Guwahati. 

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
An entertaining first half comes to a close.

Game on, @minervapunjabfc 👊

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY https://t.co/58aCbCbbox
8 minutes of injury time added. 

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
The game resumes after a short drinks break. 

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
Another chance for Thapa but this time denied by a Minerva defender. 😯

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
CLOSE! A perfect cross but unfortunately our golden boy Anirudh Thapa missed by a whisker.

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
A good possession based game so far from our boys. Is there a breakthrough coming? 🤔

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
The Minerva keeper Arshdeep Singh receives treatment to his face after the collision with Vineeth and is taken off the field in an ambulance. We hope he is fine and recovers soon.

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
The medical staff is on the field. Seems like the previous clash has caused an injury. Arshdeep will be off the field. Hope he's fine. 😥

#ChennaiyinFC #PoduMachiGoalu #AFCCup2019 #CFCInAsia #MFCvCNY
Chance! Vineeth ran alongside their defender to collect the through ball, but their goalkeeper goes down to keep the ball out!
