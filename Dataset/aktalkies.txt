Now if watching the film makes you feel complicit in enabling the social/ economic advancement of a man who not only abused power but got away it with it, that entirely depends on your personal moral compass and subjective experience of the movie. Nobody can decide that but you.
Lot has been said about art vs artist. Won’t get into that. A film is a collaborative cultural product sure but that’s precisely why it cannot be analysed in isolation of its director’s misconduct. If you watch, watch it with the consciousness of Bahl’s actions.
Everyone who outraged in October are silent spectators today because Bollywood likes to shake the status quo but not too much, not for too long. Just enough to minimise their own complicity as enablers. “It’s sad ya. Btw the trailer isn’t half bad haan,” an actress told me.
Yet, despite overwhelming evidence, Bahl was given a ‘clean chit’ by a committee that was setup by Phantom (misreported earlier as committee set up by Reliance). Such stunning were the violations in procedures that a lawyer told me “there’s nothing legal about this, it’s a joke.”
Kashyap also submitted testimonies of two more women, who detailed stories of harassment by Bahl, in a sealed envelope to the Bombay HC. Actor Imran Khan told Indian Express that he knew of at least 3 more women who were harassed by Bahl. All this is a matter of public record.
In an affidavit to the Bombay HC, Kashyap said that Bahl had confessed to him about said misconduct and promised to apologise/seek treatment for the same. None of which he did. Instead, Bahl sued HuffPost/Kashyap/Motwane for defamation, seeking 10 cr in damages.
The production company, Phantom, covered-up the crime, had no procedures in place to address the situation and put the woman in situations where she had to face Bahl after the incident. In Oct last year, Kashyap told me "We didn't handle it well. Can't blame anyone but myself."
As Super 30 releases today, a reminder that the film's director Vikas Bahl has been accused of non-consensually masturbating on an intoxicated woman and making several others uncomfortable. Bear that in mind while you watch the film, if at all you do https://t.co/zg3WQmA3yC

@renukaVyavahare @karishmau @Apurvasrani yeah I mean it’s quite complicated in the Indian context where, unlike in the West, you just can’t survive solely as a critic. Everyone has to do everything and a creative industry can’t just shut its doors on us because it doesn’t like what we say!
@Apurvasrani Instead of proposing an impractical distance one should tell this stuck-up industry to learn to take criticism and not delude itself with self-deceptions and yesmen. Instead of crying over not getting good reviews, just make better movies.
@Apurvasrani Covering a trailer launch isn’t being on their payroll. It’s literally a reporter’s job, just like how a political reporter will go and cover a rally or a press con.  And of course there’s a difference b/w critic/reporter but this memo isn’t only for the critics.
@Apurvasrani No Apurva, this isn’t just about critics, it’s ‘those who criticise.’ Many beat reporters aren’t even reviewers but may have an unflattering opinion on a movie. But their job depends on covering music launches, trailer launches etc. So to save that, they should edit their views?
A creative industry ought to be open to criticism for it to reflect, grow and challenge the status quo, not wall itself in an echo chamber where it cannot look beyond its own nose. The entitlement is nauseating.
what the hell is this nonsense ? 

Imagine a film industry so afraid of criticism that it bans those that critique it completely.

@SudhishKamath Absolutely, the trouble is when the ‘attempt to make a difference’ is valourised which the film ends up doing. That’s a troubling reinforcement of the very power dynamic it initially sought to critique.
Which raises a difficult question: If a Dalit filmmaker told this story, would he choose the policeman, under whose hands the community faces systematic brutalization, as the deliverer of justice, as a sympathteic emancipator? Unlikely.
Platforming a story would be enough if the participation of the very people whose story is being told wasn’t a concern. But it is. An unresolved concern. As Teju Cole says “There's the idea that those who are being helped ought to be consulted over the matters that concern them.”
The film may be sincere in its intent of mainstreaming conversations around discrimination, but raises complicated questions about the ownership of stories and who has the right to tell those stories.
At a cultural moment when there’s much political interest in, and conversation about, caste and marginalised communities, Article 15 captures dominant caste apathy and indifference, but also offsets it by showing Ranjan, an extension of the privileged cinegoer, as the emancipator
Was rooting for Article 15 to win. But by the end, I was wrestling with a sea of complicated emotions. In the film, the status quo remains mildly shaken but not bestirred: the Dalit must be both, brutalised by, and rescued by, the Brahmin. Review https://t.co/bnEuVR8BAe

... But then, this is a town that was long in denial about nepotism being a fact. This is also the industry that counts Salman Khan, the ultimate embodiment of toxicity, as its most successful superstar, a damning indictment of the ticket-paying audience’s misplaced sympathies.
Films capture a moment in time and years later, when we look back at 2019 and what it signified culturally, Kabir Singh would be an appropriate barometer to measure Bollywood’s apathy towards #MeToo and the troubling lens with which it continues to look at women.
That it’s made by those in the entertainment business is even worse because what they are effectively doing is infantilising the power and influence of their own medium. We gauge the success of a movie not just by the money it makes but by the cultural footprint it leaves behind.
Telling people to be okayyy with Kabir Singh in a post #MeToo era is like lauding a movie about a dishy cow-vigilante whose superpower is lynching. "It's just a movie" is the laziest argument there could be.
Been following the chatter around Kabir Singh. That there's a *debate* about the film being problematic is laughable. Romanticising a violent man and giving him a laudatory narrative is, well, messed up. But what does the film's success say about us? Read

@HitchhikerQ @HuffPostIndia Nope it wasn’t. We are referring to this video https://t.co/QyOTrmSw1c
On a darker note, AIB’s unravelling is an indictment of a moment where too many brands use the language of feminism to push products, promote themselves and make money, while begging off when asked to actually live up to the principles they espouse in their Insta stories.
The interviews suggest that the fall of AIB was consistent with the logic of the influencer economy: the forces that fuelled its stratospheric rise — Twitter, internet culture, virality and advertiser-driven growth — also propelled its rapid end.
This granular account on AIB’s rise and fall is based on several months of reporting and interviews with Bhat, Joshi, Shakya and Khamba, and six former AIB employees — four of whom are women.
In Sep, I was at the AIB office to do a profile. Days later, #MeToo hit India and AIB, which had built itself as a woke enterprise, vanished into Internet oblivion. I spent the next few months putting together the story of what led to their sudden demise https://t.co/5PIckF1o0V
