@chhabs @BajpayeeManoj @mangeshkarlata @Apurvasrani @satyarainagpaul All this because of @mangeshkarlata and her beautiful, heartfelt rendition of a song by the great Madan Mohan.

@chhabs @BajpayeeManoj @mangeshkarlata @Apurvasrani @satyarainagpaul Also I took this shot of the feet because we had enough time only to do a couple of shots and not enough to do a new scene.

The most unheralded and crucial aspect of a film is editing. #Article15 is very well edited by Yasha Ramchandani. The film has a beautiful rhythm and the story telling through  performances and visuals is enhanced by Yasha's control of the narrative.

#Article15 is also a very, very well written film. @anubhavsinha and @sirfgaurav make a great team. Their writing is relevant and very special.
Also Kumud Mishra and Manoj Pahwa. Such spectacular actors. Anubhav brings out the best in them...

@ashokepandit I've never been selective Ashokeji. You also know that. Having said that let's work together and not against each other.
@ashokepandit Please read what I've said before you speak sir..  it's in the papers and on the web.
If you feel so strongly and if you are genuinely concerned please do your thing. Stop using a child's condemnable and heinous murder to draw attention to yourself. Stop using this tragedy to further your 'us' and 'them' agenda. Stop misusing this forum for your whataboutery.
Is this #NewIndia? https://t.co/EFui5SIrq8
@ashokepandit Have I been disrespectful? Why is the pot calling the kettle black? Again your tweet reeks of insinuation and a prejudiced mind. I will continue to speak and do what I feel is right - irrespective of any provocation by you. You are a dear colleague and let's keep it that way.
The men who murdered Twinkle Sharma were murderers &amp; the severest punishment is the least they deserve. Any such heinous act is condemnable &amp; must unite us in grief, empathy and anger. Instead Ashokeji has made this a matter of religion &amp; prejudice. This is extremely insensitive.
The least I can expect from a colleague (and as somebody who as president of IFTDA I should look up for guidance) is some maturity &amp; lack of prejudice. Yes we can differ on many things including politics but does that justify unecessary name-calling  on a public forum?
Also what is disturbing is that Ashokeji is the elected president of  our director's association. As a member, colleague and as one who has respectful and cordial relations with him I feel sad that he continues to make these insinuations and calls  me names like many trolls do.

This was a film I will always cherish. Wonderful performances, some great moments and such profound grief. And of course the chartbuster #MuskuraneKiWajah by the melodious team of @jeetmusic, @raiisonai and @TeamRashmiVirag. Wish more people had heard our other songs too!

Dear Rahul, 

Please do not listen to Mr. Yadav. People like him from your party &amp; outside it have led to the present state of your party. The Congress needs to self-extinguish NOW. It must emerge from the ashes as a new force. At this point suicide is better than a slow death. https://t.co/GEJlSpX0fb
Now that the elections are over can this nonsense also stop? Can Rahul Kanwal take on a party spokesperson job officially instead of masquerading as a newsperson? Can politicians do their job instead of shouting people down on TV ? Can Nikhil Wagle go back to being a journalist? https://t.co/3AXG9awn5u
