The good thing with the pay TV decoder is that buyers have the option to convert it to a free-to-air decoder whenever they want. Switching to a free-to-air decoder will, however, attract a fee that can be specified by the StarTimes representatives.  #ManUvsInterOnStarTimes
With the pay TV decoder, one has to pay monthly subscriptions that are dependent on the package one wishes to have. The free-to-air decoder comes with no subscription fees but it has fewer channels that are mainly local.  #ManUvsInterOnStarTimes
StarTimes Kenya provides two options when purchasing a decoder; the first is a pay TV decoder and the other is a free-to-air decoder.  #ManUvsInterOnStarTimes
The company offers great entertainment with a multitude of channels offered by the decoder.   #ManUvsInterOnStarTimes
It focuses on providing general entertainment for all audiences. StarTimes packages offer entertainment, sports, documentary, religion, and news channels. #ManUvsInterOnStarTimes
