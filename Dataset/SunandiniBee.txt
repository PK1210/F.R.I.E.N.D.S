@MiniShivaMenon @seagullbooks Hope you like it as much once you've read it!!
@MiniShivaMenon No no, Mini. The lights in you are brighter than a thousand splendid suns.
One of the most magnificent pieces I think I will ever read on the light that Nabarun Bhattacharya was despite the darkness he saw and railed against. Bravo, @nilanjanab. https://t.co/f9mzZ3hyeB
@markhaber713 @seagullbooks You are a super person and those are all super books! Thank you for giving them room!!
@PiyuK @RoliBooks You're the bestest best!!
@RoliBooks It's gorgeous!!! Congratulations!!
@roughghosts If you lived closer, I‚Äôd bring that coffee over. Hang in there. Seek succour and relief and better weather and courage in the books, in the words you love and live for. Yes we‚Äôre all alone but we‚Äôre all together too. In this crazy mad thing called life.
@roughghosts I know we‚Äôre terribly far away but please please know that you‚Äôve got all of us.
Thrilled that Nabarun Bhattacharya‚Äôs Harbart (@NewDirections) gets a spot in the @NewYorker!! @seagullbooks @nilanjanab @be_tatha https://t.co/My21dZJCLv
So excited about this! Thank you @NewDirections for giving the book a shot, and for all the hard work you‚Äôve put into it! Wishing Harbart the best of luck! @seagullbooks https://t.co/841dsJW10W
@senarijit @shonedeep @RoutledgeLit Brilliant brilliant BRILLIANT!!
Thank you @4_columns for this terrific review of Nabarun Bhattacharya's Harbart, releasing from @NewDirections (USA) and @seagullbooks (India, UK and the rest of the world) in June. 'Is it an important novel? Absolutely.' https://t.co/Hf8Lqa6N2p
Great review here by Lindsay Semel of Nabarun Bhattacharya's Harbart (25 June, @NewDirections): 'Harbart is a haunted man . . . a victim-participant in the forward march of capitalism and of the impetus to assign significance to the pointlessness and chaos of material existence.' https://t.co/ZudvvBUpe2
@nathansmcnamara @NewDirections @lithub Ah, thank YOU for saying so, and for reading it and liking it . . . I'm thrilled because this is a book very close to my heart. Thank you especially for 'seeing' the city as Nabarun saw it.
@nathansmcnamara @NewDirections @lithub Thank you!!!
