Trump is going to screen Cats at the White House. “Amazing cats, where did you find these cats who could talk?”
@funhousejournal Yeah. Supposedly his health was failing by then and HD def looks better than EGMD which is ROUGH but you can see the decline.
It’s also uncomfortable that both Even Gods Must Die and Hunger Dogs foreground brutal war in ways that even the most epic combat of the main books never approached tonally. So much of the elegance and optimism is gone.
The final two Kirby Fourth World pieces, in which he was brought back on well past his prime and almost as an afterthought to get those characters brought into main DC continuity, are mainly just bummers compared to the beauty and singular verve of the true books. A shame.

Glenn Hughes might be the most unfairly overlooked vocalist in rock history(only King’s X’s Doug Pinnick comes close). He was imo the best vocalist Deep Purple ever had despite being a backup for David Coverdale(lol) and he meshes VERY well with Iommi

@DanSchindel Also I know nothing about Kyle Rayner but just based on concept alone he’s so much more interesting than Hal
@DanSchindel And like, Wally just has SO much to him, so much personality and drive and individuality. Easily the best “replacement” hero ever, a character who never once feels like a stand in or a gimmick
@DanSchindel I’m so so happy that Waid’s run is now fully available (or at least the big run before Morrison and Millar briefly ran it). I’ve only read the first book of it but even that sort of reset is so wonderful, so modern in outlook but so breezy and joyous

KC is especially interesting to come back to after reading Irredeemable, an even more perilous what-if scenario about heroes gone bad that is still, somehow, a tribute, and starting Waid’s Flash run, which is refreshingly old-fashioned amid the Dark Age but still modern

@NerdHeather Hmmmm I’m not at SDCC tho?
@LeeCameren Yeah I love nearly all of the ur-texts of the Dark Age except for The Killing Joke, which I think low-key had the most influence on that era of comics but took things way too far without the sense of purpose (or tbh fandom) of TDKR or Watchmen
@LeeCameren Yeah now knowing the context of like, Hal being turned evil, Kyle Rayner’s gf being fridged, etc you can see how absurdly, meaninglessly bleak comics were getting but KC also follows a lot of throughlines to somber places (Batman basically being in a full body cast esp stings)
@Hatercles Reading the Kirby Fourth World omni makes me really appreciate that Morrison above all others is maybe Kirby's true heir. An artist of boundless creativity who understands and leans into the weirdness but also the inherent hope of comics
thus far Waid and Morrison are my two fav writers, in part bc they can easily operate within modern parameters of seriousness but both argue for the value of continuity, symbolism and aspirational themes of the genre's roots
Kingdom Come was one of the first comics I ever read and I was of course struck by Alex Ross's art but man it's so much better to revisit it now and realize what a scathing comment the whole thing was on the meaningless darkness of modern comics
