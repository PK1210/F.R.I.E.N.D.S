Its the most fuckin bullshit and a biased rule .. is the super over , which is one fuckin over , more important than the actual 50 over match ... just asking @ICC @cricketworldcup
If in a super over a country can win by the virtue of more boundaries then why can a country not win by the virtue of losing lesser wickets in the actual match? There is a serious problem with the your rules @ICC @cricketworldcup
