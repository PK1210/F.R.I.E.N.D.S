Boeing downplayed this beefed-up MCAS to the FAA. It never told FAA officials responsible for determining training about the more powerful version, and asked the FAA for clearance to remove MCAS from the training manual. 
https://t.co/EBXJNbTCdK
After MCAS was made more powerful, many people working on the Max didn’t fully comprehend the scope of the changes. Test pilots, engineers and regulators all made decisions based on the assumption that MCAS was less powerful and reliant on multiple inputs.
https://t.co/EBXJNbTCdK
In early 2016, less than a year before the Max was finished, Boeing engineers made MCAS way more powerful. This was pivotal. As part of this change, they made MCAS reliant on just one sensor, instead of two. (Early designs also used the accelerometer.)
