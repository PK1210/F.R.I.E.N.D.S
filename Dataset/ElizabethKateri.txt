Scaraffia's magazine, Women Church World, is printed by the Vatican; and she is using her platform to fight Catholic patriarchy from the inside.
But she believes abortion should be legal; and she envisions a church that is generous in mercy and tolerance for anyone, especially women, who does not conform to clerical teaching on sex and love.
Scaraffia's feminist heterodoxy is complicated ‚Äì she does not want women to be priests; she does not want women to take birth control.
