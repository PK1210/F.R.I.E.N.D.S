आपकी इन शुभेच्छाओं के बदले फिलहाल आपको बस यही संकल्प दे सकता हूं कि 2020 में देश के लिए एक और स्वर्ण पदक जीतकर लाऊंगा. 

बस ऐसे ही बने रहें मेरे साथ...

देवेंद्र झाझड़िया
आज जन्मदिन के मौके पर आप सब मित्रों, शुभचिंतकों की ओर से मिल रही भरपूर शुभकामनाओं से अभिभूत हूं. आपका यही स्नेह और प्यार मेरे कंधों को इतना मज़बूत करता है कि थ्रो किया हुआ जेवलिन सीधा पदक पर लगता है. 
मैं गांधीनगर, गुजरात में 2020 के टोक्यो पैरा ओलंपिक की तैयारी में जुटा हूं.
