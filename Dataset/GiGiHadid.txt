@HADlDXO yup. I understand. Unfortunately in this day and age all points have to be touched on, if not, people will start going after this argument and speaking as if late-term abortions are the norm. Needed to get that out of the way to get to my actual point. x
Sorry, thought it’d be clear that my opinion on that doesn’t include medical emergencies. I don’t feel that an emergency is part of a choice- like you said, both lives at risk ! xx https://t.co/DegAlT5KRM
@shardaebriann Sorry, thought it’d be clear that my opinion on that doesn’t include medical emergencies. I don’t feel that an emergency is part of a choice- like you said, both lives at risk!! xx
No one knows what happens behind closed doors.Maybe things we can’t even imagine.I don’t support late term abortion, but in early stages, no one else’s opinion matters if a woman does not feel that she can safely bring a child into this world;Every child deserves love &amp; stability https://t.co/SCE4ZHLD8m

@MctavAnnie Synthroid helped with my body swelling/water retention but made me very shakey and my energy crashes were still really bad, especially if I was late taking it. My energy levels have been the hardest to take control of.
@MctavAnnie Out of curiosity ... when did you start synthroid ? I got diagnosed very young, 15 .... so they said synthroid is made for / safe to take starting middle-aged.. that’s why I personally had to find an alternative! But it’s so helpful for everyone to add their personal stories here
I spent a few months every year in Mexico growing up (my parents had work there for a period of time)... and it’s always amazing and comforting to get back to and experience the gentle open energy, big hearts, and beautiful positive spirits of Mexican people and culture !!!!! 💛 https://t.co/EJNJapHxN7

You’re young, we shouldn’t be taking synthetic thyroid meds if we don’t need to. There are holistic ways that won’t have long term negative effects on your body !!! Talk to alternative doctors &amp; find out what your options are :) that’s my advice just based on personal experience!
If your thyroid hasn’t been removed, and is just under active, find out what state your immune system is in. Once you deal with the underlying causes within your body (which most dr’s don’t check for unfortunately) it’s possible to regain a more normal thyroid function — https://t.co/rfZNqeDEDo

@beautifvltragic Nah it just annoys me when people talk and have opinions on situations and people they know nothing about. My agent is a kind, hardworking, intelligent person and is one of the best so I’m not going to let kids undermine that.
@feeeyaaaa @GigiHadidHF Also, I should say... in the last year or so I’ve learned the balance that I need in my life to stay physically and mentally healthy and happy. Jobs I take are for a reason, as are jobs I pass on. Many people aren’t blessed w a team that understands &amp; supports them in that way.
@feeeyaaaa @GigiHadidHF Lol. My manager doesn’t just say yes to everything for money- that doesn’t mean the options don’t come. This industry is about strategizing so that nights like last night could happen.. &amp; we have more coming. Until you have  been an agent for 23 yrs do not speak on Luiz.

I’m not saying postmates is the biggest world issue.

(cont) you have heard from enough people whose time and money you’ve wasted to act like you don’t know what’s going on- it takes away from the hardworking Postmates you do have. Just do better.
(cont) The amount of times food is damaged, taken, or doesn’t arrive correctly is only less disgraceful than how your CS Representatives act from an unreachable pedestal. Your one-sandwich refund is just annoying after 5-10 business days and (cont)
