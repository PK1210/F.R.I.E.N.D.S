Thank you for the lead.
@har777 Open system with permeable boundaries. Not boundary-less system.

There still have to be a minimal set of good rules, else the system becomes chaotic.
@animeshkmr73 What is it then?
@har777 Yes. We discussed how such systems have permeable boundaries. This gives the system the ability to solve problems creatively. Such system works on aligned aspirations. Therefore, unlike closed systems, where the second law of Thermodynamics applies, the adaptive systems improve.
government aided village school*

And the data is from the surrounding villages.
@har777 Arrey baba, I know the law. He said the opposite happens in the case of complex self-adaptive systems! 

I should have posted an explanation note with the picture.
So, you are right, the Education Ministry does seem like an isolated system. 
Someone needs to make a ‚Äòfirki‚Äô of it and throw it out at such a velocity that the gravity threshold is crossed and we never see it again.
The problem will remain unless there is a structure in place for addressing Teacher Eligibility and Teacher Training. The adhikaris who are supposed to monitor schools and teachers are harassed. This also opens space for corruption.
So, the ‚Äòquantity‚Äô is certainly not a problem. And yet, we have a massive problem of unemployable, ‚Äòeducated‚Äô population. 

The quality of education sucks!
The prathmik vidyalaya in my village has 2 teachers (who draw a salary of 85,000/- per month). And do you know how many students go to that school?

5
There are 15 schools within a radius of 5 kms. These include, parishadiya, government, government-aided and private schools. And this covers only 12 villages on the either side of the road. There would be more schools as you move inside.
Reminds me of a conversation I had with my mother who is a principal in government aided school in UP. The sample size was small, but the data still made me weep with helplessness. https://t.co/nxIoQ6P6Xj
@comrade_saffron He used it to explain a reverse parallelism, if I can use that term.

He spoke in favour of a complex self-adaptive, permeable system with minimal set critical rules, and not an isolated one :)

However, I am not an expert. The talk was novel for me. Hence, I shared it :)

h) Stream of Consciousness makes complete sense to you. NOW?

i) "Damn! Where was this ingenuity during the exams?" You exclaim!
You are confronted by the 'real' time as you plead guilty of the 'sin of gluttony': "How am I glutted with the conceit of this...that I tasted the joys of heaven?"
g) Your over-enthusiastic use of the oxy-MORON results in your fall from 'Grace'.
f) In the psychological spacetime continuum you relish the joys of the 'sinful' Heaven (shhh...that's a blasphemous oxymoron), and like Dr. Faustus, feel: "Am I not tormented with ten thousand hells/ In being deprived of [this]...bliss [everyday]?"
e) You become a pro at time-travel, traversing psychological and real/chronological time (if alive, Virgina Woolf would have been impressed).
d) You find it difficult to digest (no pun intended) that Literary Theory can have such a lucid explanation: Indeed, Heaven and Hell are a state of mind as governed by the accessibility, or the inaccessibility of the aforementioned 'plate'.
In your hallucination, you begin to comprehend those lines: "[A plate of ghee-laden dal-chawal, aloo-beans subzi and halwa in] its own place, and in it self / Can make a Heaven of Hell, [and, in absence of the subject under reference] a Hell of Heaven!"
c) You are transported to the class of 2006, where Dr. Christel Devdawson is teaching Milton's Paradise Lost.
b) You bless the cook and try to remember as many adjectives as you can, both for the cook and the cooked (cursing yourself, all the while, for not taking Norman Lewis seriously).
a) You are blessed by your perpetually starved gustatory cells, and on a micro level, by the mitochondria (because I did not wish to be a doctor, they never believed me, but I did take Biology lessons seriously).
