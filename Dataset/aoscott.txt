@mattsinger while I was composing that tweet my own cat, who often disappears into the far recesses of the house for days on end, suddenly showed up in the living room and sat down next to me on the sofa. something is going on.

@melvillmatic @sheilakathleen though I was a book critic in the pre-smartphone, pre-wifi era so basically reading was the only option on the subway or in a coffee shop. I suspect it would be harder to find the time now.
@sheilakathleen @melvillmatic having been both a film and a book critic I've found film to be more of a problem in this way because you can always find pockets of time for reading (or at least I could in the pre-twitter days) whereas movies demand a solid block of 2-3 hours (including travel).
