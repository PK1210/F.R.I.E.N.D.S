You can tell when a grief-stricken, emotionally-wrecked character has been written by a woman. #Fleabag
@rajani92812220 Second, the actor's claims are based on mere assumptions and her own myopic and convenient understanding of the issue. The section of media, which condemned her, also has many people, who showered praise for her work in the film. Read up. Get your facts right. Then talk.
@rajani92812220 Fake news seems to be in vogue. So, a quick fact check for you here.
No one trolled a martyr's name. A joke was cracked about the numerable controversies around Manikarnika and it was on the film's title not on the martyr Manikarnika.
RT @TheRestlessQuil: @igtamil Was there a film called Me Too? If not what sense does this callous, moronic headline make?
@shilparathnam Thank you!!!!!!
@SidAvi6 @JustinJRao First things first, she is proud of her son. Secondly, stop holding mothers responsible for what their sons do or not. The onus of one's actions is on the individual not on his or her parents.
@Sanjukta_SS @JustinJRao Ask people to divert attention somewhere else rather than  tagging me. If you tag me, expect a response.
@rajani92812220 @dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Language reported. He was her friend, no? She also had lunch with him. So, she can definitely call him again. :) 

Oh, wait. How will she? On what basis? They were neither ever friends, nor even has lunch together. Lol. Lol.
@rajani92812220 Interrogation? How poorly are you informed about this case? There was no "interrogation" first of all. She explained politely? Umm, by calling journalists anti national and that they come at media events to eat free food?
@ajay36mittal @Rangoli_A I never even called his personal posts proof of his journalism. Hahaha! You can't even stall properly. Bring one tweet where I wrote his tweets stand for his journalism? Jhooth bolein toh proof ke saath bolein.
@ajay36mittal @Rangoli_A Mind your language, first of all. It's deplorable. You guys put little mind in getting yourself educated about something and hence quick to defame someone. 

You're anyway a hypocrite. Till the time I praised your favourite artistes, you liked it. And now getting personal. Lol
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao You asked me if I would have been fine her talking it out with him in person? Who am I to be fine or not in this case. I can only call out right and wrong and that too on the basis of facts. So, yes ideally she should have sorted out in a personal space.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Again wrong. One was surprised because the other party, in this case a celeb, is lying. I am repeating myself but here we go. She accused him of calling her jingoistic for making Manikarnika, which he did not do and hence till today there's no proof.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Freedom of expression does not come with these restrictions in the constitution. There are Twitter rules by the way, which prohibit someone to make use of derogatory language. And still people enjoy the power of abusing others.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Don't agree. No one's forcing you to. Social media responsibility is very important and hence abusive language against people, calling them "nange, bikau, anti nationals" should be prohibited.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist I get that seriously. Hence, saying she could have taken it up with him on a personal level. To malign someone for an apparent smear campaign in a professional space is unethical and unprofessional. Simple.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Kangaan went personal in her professional capacity. She was at a song launch, as an actor there to promote her song and speak to media on a professional basis. She wasn't at a personal/private bash or function where she met her friends from the media.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Personal twitter'facebook/instagram accounts are personal for a reason. If you aren't explicitly mentioning that you are tweeting/writing/posting in your professional capacity, it's understood that's your personal space.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao We weren't taught our careers would be at risk if we make fun of actors in our personal capacity. A journalist is never taught that. Do you understand how trolls function? Maybe not. Please read up. Third, the actor is blamed for calling him anti-national. That's defamatory.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao I will repeat it's unfair to ask people to censor their expression so that they don't get professionally harmed.  That's unprofessional and unethical. He has to right now think because the powerful is curbing freedom.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Arey! Why should someone risk his or her career because of his or her personal opinion? So, the powerful can do whatever and people should censor them for the fear of losing their jobs? That's not freedom. He is entitled to joke in his personal space.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao If I were not open to take different opinion, this debate wouldn't have even lasted. The fact that I kept repeating myself despite making myself clear on one thing already speaks volumes of my attitude and patience.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao You too take care. Thank you for a peaceful debate. Makes it easier to engage. And thank you for your advice but not needed at the moment. Your assumptions are actually hilarious and for the lack of better word, I go ha ha.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Hahaha! I talk with facts. Don't warn me. I understand how Twitter debates function. How they are observed, documented and then used against someone. So, do not use that with me "hope you can prove it." Nope.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao I am getting personal towards you? Now this debate has moved from accusation, whataboutery to lies. Nice.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Kangana Ranaut has three films coming up. She is famous. She is an award winner. She will move on to her next. While Justin Rao will have to keep his Instagram private so that trolls don't call him anti-national and not abuse his parents.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao After she called him anti-national, people began calling him anti-national. Do you know the pain of that label? Do you understand how a bunch of lies can actually harm someone, who is so low in the hierarchy? The actors have capital, relationships with the powerful.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Kangana Ranaut has multiple platforms to peddle her lies. Him, being a journalist and a reporter- who is always more of a foot soldier- has to think twice to say anything. Do you realise when a star badmouths a reporter in public the way she did what repercussions it has?
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao His parents got abused. Rangoli Chandel- Kangana Ranaut's manager- publicly called for his arrest. Just so you know, she has a verified account and is far more powerful than an agency reporter of four years experience.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao She started it all. Repeating myself but she started it at the event of her film promotion! So, of course media will talk about her. Btw, media is talking about the film in its interviews with its writer, Rajkummar Rao. She's not some victim.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Hahahahahahahaha! Funny beyond words! His family vacation was already planned. So, he should stop having a life because an actor cannot see a journalist standing up for himself. Watch the video, not only the promo. That's how you will learn.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao There's not a single post or tweet on social media where he called her "jingoistic for making Manikarnika." When Justin Rao replied to her that he did not, she repeated herself. So much conviction! But till date she hasn't shared the proof of her allegation.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Third, she didn't give him an "earful". She accused him, wrongfully. She attacked his thinking in a professional space. Wrong.
Now, another fact check. She accused Justin Rao called her jingoistic for making Manikarnika. Yet she hasn't produced a single tweet where he wrote this.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao He got an earful for? Imaginary smear campaign? (already explained with numbers) Lol. For the brand of  National Award-winner being hurt by a journalist with four-year-old profession, who has posted 15 times about her in 40 months? Lol.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Watch it for yourself. Trolling? Do you know what trolling is? Go read comments under actors' pictures/posts or because we are talking about Justin Rao, read comments on his Twitter. That's called trolling.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao One can expect not to ever have a personal relationship with a celebrity if or she is making fun of him or her because that's a celebrity's personal call. But no, no one deserves any consequence on his or her career for a tweet. Nope.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Fact Check: He made comments in a personal space. Second, he does not work in "tabloid media". Get your facts right. He works with a news agency, PTI. Google it to learn about it functioning. 
You have shown you don't know the difference between personal and professional spaces.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Also, when you thought I was a close acquaintance of Justin Rao courtesy "Twitter", why did you tag me to learn from someone with an unbiased view? In your words, family or someone close cannot be unbiased.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Again, you mean to say you put a comment tagging me to learn more about the incident- where you begin with a bias, a judgment ready- and you never expected me to see. So, why to tag me? You wanted to learn about this incident? You could've gone anywhere else.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao I am talking on facts and that's making you change the tone of this debate from accusation to whataboutery. You are in fact swinging between these two things. And I expect that because, facts. :)
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao When I am presenting you facts with my answers, that shows my unbiased view. I am not saying things on the basis of my assumption. I am saying and countering with information, facts and logic. Rationality comes in place when someone's not biased.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao If you weren't expecting me to respond, why did you comment here? So, you meant to raise questions and speculation and criticise without expecting all of it to get a response? I thought the one, who started it, should be prepared.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Also, stressing on this again. Bringing someone's supposed relationship in a debate just to raise question on that person's arguments and stand is downright wrong and an expression of escapism.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Now, coming to my tone. I was a witness. I have been an alibi. I know what happened and what are lies. And hence, I put my point with as many facts as possible, which make you feel I don't have objectivity. It's on you.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao You defended her sister's reaction by saying one cannot expect objectivity from family after I mentioned how Rangoli Chandel has made it clear she speaks on Kangana's behalf, which means she represents the actor's views. That make those tweets questionable.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Again because you mentioned the other journalist. His tone, his words and his expression were condemnable. They epitomised attacking and I stand by it.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao promo video? See the full video. Headline doesn't mean the whole story? Displeasure is not shown by pointing finger at someone from the stage. Attack is shown in body language too. She raised her voice. That's attacking too.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Don't talk about my objectivity or lack of it. I was present there when this happened. I am an eye-witness. I am a journalist and talk only on the basis of facts.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Law? Get me proof of this law, which works against a person, who is expressing his or her opinion in a personal space. If anything law supports that. Indian law does at least, in case you are not aware. Which space are you talking from? Where is the objectivity?
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Fourth, look at my way of debating with you and look at Rangoli Chandel's language. You're telling me one can get away calling out for physical violence against someone in the name of being a family member? Woah!
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Bringing my personal relationship here and that too on the basis of "Twitter" is unethical and unfair. Secondly, Kangana Ranaut "attacked" a journalist, not vice versa. Third, Rangoli Chandel's her manager also and she made it clear she had her "approval". She represent her.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao So, who made it public? Who took things to a whatsapp group, Instagram, Twitter and a video? Justin Rao was her friend, no? According to her he texted her once. So, she had her number. She could have texted him or gotten a meeting set up where the two parties could've sorted out.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao And FYI, Kangana Ranaut's derogatory message about journalists was Kangana never apologising to the media. So, by Rangoli Chandel's admission, even this tweet had Kangana Ranaut's approval.
By also targeting rest of the journalists, Kangana Ranaut's manager made things far more public than they ever could be. Then the actor herself released a video (on July 11) where she not only defamed Justin Rao with unceremonious language but also used the same for others.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Nothing was kept between the two people. While Justin Rao kept silent, Kangana Ranaut's manager was unstoppable on Twitter. She quoted a news report that said media to demand apology from Kangana and abused media, calling them "Nange, bikau, deshdrohi, desh ke dalal."
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Kangana Ranaut's manager went on to retweet all those tweets, which abused Justin- one called him a whimp- and then herself called for physical violence against him and asked Government of India to take action against him. All this was done on a public platform.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao The next day, July 8, Rangoli Chandel, Kangana Ranaut's manager &amp; sister, who says (I have proof) she writes everything about the actor with her permission, began defaming Justin on her Twitter account with 42K followers. Another attempt to make it public.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao It was between two people, no? The one party "rushed to her car," and never tried to sort it out. Her PR came on media whatsapp gp (which has over 250 media professionals) with accusations against Justin, addressing "all her media friends," making it public yet again.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Hahaha! Tell it to the actor, who was condemned and then had her sister hurling abuses at journalists and then herself put out a video with more abuses. Clearly shows who couldn't take it. Funny how you started with him being unprofessional and now totally changed the tune.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao What are we even talking about when Kangana Ranaut in that video claims she wants media to ban her. That's a testament of her power. That she can abuse the hell out of people, calling them "chindi and anti national" and still call herself a victim.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao You mean to tell me Justin should have been prepared to be bullied by an actor because he took digs at her in a personal capacity? Are you reading what you are writing? He didn't "start" anything. It's the actor, who started, and hence should've been prepared to take it.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Why people stand with him is because he was right. Simple. Take that. It's exactly how people from journalists to audience stood with Kangana when she took a man, who was more powerful than her. Why? Because she was right.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Justin Rao is a journalist, who is four year old in the field. He is less powerful than three time National-Award winner Kangana Ranaut by miles. It's so funny you can't see this, that you think he "had" people boycott her? Hahahaha! He is inconsequential in front of her.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao They condemned her for her behaviour. No one has the right to dole out personal attack on a journalist in a professional space. That's what's condemnable. Boycott speaks for the journalists' reminder to artistes that they won't take ill-treatment.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Entertainment journalists and artistes belong to one big fraternity. There's a give and take. No, I am not comparing his observant humour to her nepotism remarks. I am talking about how personal "ideology" and professional commitments are kept separated.
@Ishaqzaadiii @saaniisweet Just watched the Hindi one. Aryan's voice is lovely and modulation on point. Also, absolutely impressed with Shah Rukh, Shreyas Talpade and Ashish Vidyarthi.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao The link: https://t.co/eP0ZvMQkFS
She added she still believed in her ideology. But by your logic, if someone makes a remark against someone, with whom he or she has to work, that's unprofessional. So, the actor in question was either unprofessional then or is being now. :)
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao A year after her nepotism remark, Kangana Ranaut appeared on Karan Johar's talent hunt show. Her statement read, "I am looking forward to being on the show. It is a professional commitment for which I'm being paid." She added she still stuck to her ideology.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Hahaha! So conducting interviews without being unbiased is not a testament of someone's professionalism? But his personal opinion is? Omg! You are repeating the oxymoron.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Hahahaha! You're comparing observant humour to personal attack. My oh my! This is exhausting. Kangana's behaviour was unprofessional irrespective of her disagreement. Fact check: it was the actor, who couldn't take difference of opinion and lost it on stage.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist The actions the other guy, who got aggressive, were condemned in front of the film's producer. It's on record. It has been informed to him in person also as well by the Guild.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Easy prey? That's a convenient narrative. If an artiste misbehaves well with media, then either apologise or don't engage. If worse has been done then this becomes justified? That's whataboutery. There wasn't any association in place earlier. But now it is, which is good.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist When a large section of media wrote and reported that went in her favour, it's doing its job. But when the same section report, which is not her favour, it's called ganging up? Thats hypocrisy. Told you condemnation and praise are both part of our job.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist The reaction would have been equal if the reaction was made in a personal space. In fact it was assured to him that the actor would personally talk to him after the event and minutes after the event, the actor rushed to her car and left.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist And that's because journalists know how to differentiate between personal opinion and professional behaviour.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Hahah! In a line of fire in his professional space? Media associations have shown support for him. He has earned support because the actor went personal while he remained professional.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Now, if for once one buys Kangana's lie about them being friends, is it not unprofessional to invoke one's friendship in press conference, which is a professional set up?
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist If you clearly watch that video, Justin Rao is heard saying, "Kangana, you could have refused taking my question. But you attacked my thinking and that's personal."
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Telling a journalist you are not comfortable taking their question is a choice. But maligning them with a remark like "gandi soch laate kahan se ho?" and a bunch of lies about him texting her personally and him being her friend earlier is a personal attach and unprofessionalism.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist This is firing but here you go. Kangana made a "personal" remark on a journalist in a "professional" space. It was a song launch and media and artistes was there to engage professionally. It wasn't a personal party where they both were speaking to.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist You admit he wrote this in his personal capacity and yet call him unprofessional? Lol. That's an oxymoron. You don't judge someone's professionalism on the basis of their personal opinion unless he or she brings that personal opinion into professional space.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Taking digs at someone on a personal level and yet maintaining utmost professionalism is the hallmark of a journalist, of a professional. Not bringing your personal bias in your professional interaction with an artiste is what an ethical journalist does.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Your whole opinion about someone's journalism is based on his or her Twitter account, which in itself is wrong. I can joke about an actor and yet write report on him/her objectively and come up with their fantastic interviews.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist You have a myopic understanding of entertainment journalism in Bollywood. I would suggest you to start reading beyond speculative and opinion pieces. There's massive credible reportage on Hindi cinema  and its artistes by many jourmalists here.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Justin Rao writes for a news agency, far from what a tabloid is. His journalism thrives on facts, observation on cinema and film artistes. There's not a single gossip piece he has ever written or endorsed in a professional capacity. And that's not what tabloids do
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Kangana's courage to state the facts about an industry where most actresses are forced to remain is what media stood by because everything that she said from nepotism to power abuse were facts.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist You wrongly questioned journalists by saying they "condemned" her when she asked questions. I was just reminding you that it was actually the opposite. There's no sense of entitlement. it's a reminder to an artiste that media stands by facts and what's ethical.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist I don't need to justify because there's nothing to justify. Lol.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Kangana Ranaut first said he ran a massive smear campaign against her. It turned out (courtesy screenshots by her manager), there were just 15 posts by Justin Rao in 40 months  her (including the ones in her praise). That's a very poor smear campaign lol.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist The proof of Justin Rao's professionalism are her interviews of Kangana Ranaut. Go, read them if you can take out time from mindlessly blaming someone.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Also while we are on these Facebook posts, kindly stalk a little more and take out screenshots of the posts where Justin Rao wrote in favour of the actor. But that weakens someone's case, no. :)
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist And even if a journalist condemns her how's that wrong? If she goes on to condemn others, so can journalists. Ever heard about opinion pieces?

The liberal media she's attacking today stood by her every time she wanted to be heard. The same media asked questions to the powerful.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Who condemned her for asking someone a question? You don't your facts in place. Journalists (including Justin) hailed her and lend her voice platforms in our professional capacities because she took on the powerful, she spoke about pay disparity and gender inequality in Bollywood
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao If you can't take joke or understand humour then that's on you. Secondly, who's deviating? Lol. Just because I called out shaming of a journalist for his or her opinion (funny or not) doesn't mean I am deviating. If you start an attack, get ready for a reply.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao That's called observant humour. And everyone is entitled to a sense of humour. The cold vibes between the co-stars is much visible in the picture and was also speculated for your information. That's a funny take on the same.
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao A journalist, however, must never let his/her personal opinion interfere with his/her work. And Justin Rao has been objective in his work as a journalist. But wait, to know that, one needs to read his work. Reading up on someone's work needs more efforts than trolling them. :)
@dorji2000 @GuildJournalist @JustinJRao Someone doesn't need your validation on his or journalism. His work speaks for itself. Journalists are also entitled to their personal opinion. Their professional position does not restrict them from their personal opinion.
@dorji2000 @KanganaTeam @Rangoli_A @GuildJournalist Your comments clearly show lack of knowledge about several things like journalism and freedom of speech. So, let me tell you. What a person writes on his/her social media is in a personal capacity. It has no bearing on a person's professional position unless explicitly mentioned.

And now this will be incessantly attacked by her fans/trolls and why not after all, the actor has called for freedom for trolls ans her own manager (in her name) attacks anyone she does not agree with. :)
With this episode, #KanganaRanaut has officially become peddler of fake news. So, for her information, a fact check:

Making fun of a film's title DOES NOT mean making fun of a martyr. 

I don't need to attach the proof for your manager Rangoli Chandel has circulated it enough. https://t.co/yiS3tcTZYm

@raschmatasch @vipinistweeting @KanganaTeam Lollll man, you make it sound so much more dramatic than it is. "Revengeful" 🙄😂 or is it a trick to use as much drama to sell a fake story? 😂
So, her fans even know what kind of supposed friendship she meant in the interview. In 4 years when two people meet only twice on a one on one basis in a strictly professional space, yes that's "casual friendship." 😂 https://t.co/0X183Bp3rM
Yeah a friend, who waited in her apartment's lobby with 30 other journalists for almost three hours for her to give bytes for her film's success PC, while she partied upstairs with her actual media friends. It cannot get funnier than this. https://t.co/gUivdakwV2

@Daiveetav @manisim1 @justinarao1 @Rangoli_A @KanganaDaily @KanganaTeam @KanganaRanautFC Hahaha! Illusion has no limits. Hence proved.
@manisim1 @Daiveetav @justinarao1 @Rangoli_A @KanganaDaily @KanganaTeam @KanganaRanautFC If after watching this video you could come with up such a defamatory and personal attack, then God bless you. I hope sense prevails.
Giving into temptation. #SareeTwitter

Also, BFF @PrernaMittra is creepy. She cannot let me bask in the limelight. But also can't help. She is too gorgeous to stay out of it. https://t.co/PIVUgnxJDt
@yamigautam Yours should be called #BlockbusterSareeTwitter.
@susheelwomaniya @IndiaMeToo Absolutely.
@susheelwomaniya @IndiaMeToo Much of my feminism was upper cast, I have now realised. Soz listening to Dalit feminists has become a part of my conscious learning and unlearning.
@susheelwomaniya @IndiaMeToo Have definitely become severely intolerant to casual sexism. Of course earned different labels for it. "forever angry" "aggressive," and blah blah. Don't give a damn though. Also, have started educating myself about intersectionality.

@ayushmannk @raisaghosh @MoharBasu Sorry for spamming but but in recent times this image comes close to one of my favourite Gulzar lines: Pyaar ko pyaar hi rehne do, koi naam na do. The essence of Meri Pyaari Bindu. ❤️ https://t.co/gyiFSuLAGV
@ayushmannk @raisaghosh @MoharBasu MPB's one of the most comforting romances I have seen. I cried &amp; how in the climax, one of the most beautifully written &amp; performed sequences in Bollywood. Ending a Bollywood romance with the message of etting go is not easy to conceive. That makes MPB unique.
