It‚Äôs been a fantastic season of #IPL Congratulations to the Chennai SuperKings and a special shout out to MSD for carrying out the season with such ease
Ajinkya Rahane not opening for RR has been the biggest mystery for me #IPL2018 . Wonder if it‚Äôs his decision or the think tank‚Äôs ?
Well done Mr Bedi! Wishing Neha and You all the love and happiness . Congratulations Brother. @NehaDhupia @Imangadbedi https://t.co/Ui6P2upy0i
SRH Bowlers setting very high standards in bowling. Simplicity of plans and clarity of thinking makes the execution flawless. Stacking up overs nicely to build pressure #SRHvRR #IPL2018
A great interactive session with some young budding school cricketers @ProStarLeague .There is abundance of talent at the grassroots level in our country.  #DiyaMaukaMaarChauka https://t.co/qyvGB0jRog
Another thrilling finish #KXIPvCSK . No team can certainly relax against CSK in  #IPL2018 . Was a treat to watch MS build this run chase for CSK , almost got them home

#CSKvKKR another exciting finish for CSK !! Superb Win
#CSKvKKR #IPL2018 is it heading towards super-over ??
#CSKvKKR #IPL2018 Game on!
#CSKvKKR some serious power hitting by Andre Russell, CSK needs a good start ... first 6 overs going to matter the most
#SRHvsRR #IPL2018 Stanlake looked very impressive with his speed and extra bounce of the wicket. SRH bowling attack is looking solid for this season
#KKRvsRCB flying start by KKR but still think there is enough in the wicket for fast bowlers to take advantage and turn the game around.Umesh has shown the signs
DD might be 15 runs short in setting the target. Fastest ever #IPL fifty by KL Rahul is certainly not going to help their cause. #KXIPvsDD superb batting display
DD is looking good at the half way mark of their innings with GG taking control nicely. #KXIPvDD
#MIvCSK T20 at it‚Äôs best ... simply unbelievable... What a match !!
#MARKANDE has certainly answered the questions on Mumbai Indians spin department with his match winning debut .... another leggie making an impact in this format #MIvCSK #IPL2018
#MIvCSK first six overs going to be the key for MI to defend this total. Surprised to see Hardik take on field after limping off the field end of the first innings
Good to see some swing at the start of #ipl2018 wickets in hand going to be key for Mumbai Indians to put up a good score
Enjoyed being part of the Curtain Raiser for #IPL2018 on #CricBuzzLive   Do join in today at 7.30 pm for the Pre-Match Analysis. #MIvsCSK https://t.co/v2ffzytV8X
