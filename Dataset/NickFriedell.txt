"So I think you see [recruiting] a lot more now where it's just players recruiting players is more powerful than the pitch meeting with the team. That's just what it is now, so it's a huge part of the game now."
"It was like they was competing against each other. Now it's, 'Well, they got three stars on their team, so I know this guy and that guy, I'm going to try to get them to come to my team.'"
"It's become huge. Because sometimes the coaches and the front offices, they don't have as much power as the players. The players are so friendly now. I think in the past it was like Jordan probably didn't go out searching and trying to get guys to come join him."
Damian Lillard has always been one of the best quotes in the league but I thought his comments today regarding how important recruiting has become were particularly poignant in the wake of the Kawhi/PG news.
