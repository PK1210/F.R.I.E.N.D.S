Still no sign of Niladri Kumar’s and Kerala drummer’s passport, I fear that our Wednesday Costa Mesa and Thursday UCLA Royce hall shows maybe in trouble 😔🙏
Just finished the Hawaii shows, Niladri Kumar could not make it due to visa delays, starting MOP tour of USA in 3 days, hope Niladri &amp; Kerala drummers get to LA in time, still no answer from USA consulate 😡
