@DeShobhaa When ur just behind doors; one loves commenting on those hogging limelight.  Just watch the show honey. Your prime is over
@MeenaDasNarayan @DeShobhaa Ooooooo.. U chopped it
@pinkvilla She became fat again
@RahulVerma4860 Sahi jawaab
@pinkvilla Telli Chapadganju she looking üòçüòç
@KRKBoxOffice @kamaalrkhan Many.. Who cares.. All do our there.. And it's fine.. Their life.. She looked better before though if u ask me
@reshii Honestly to me rhe comment smacked of - intolerance to different ways of life other than their own..  It's called - myopic vision
@reshii Simply put - food derived from grains, plants and roots.  
Nothing adulterated about it. üòåüòâ.  And nothing holy about it.   Just a choice and just a religious perspective/conditioning. Why snigger at someone else's choice?
@bombaytimes @priyankachopra @PriyankaCentral @PriyankasFans @PCsCafe Which acting and which movie?  Hello..  She is more like a has been or was
@KRKBoxOffice @kamaalrkhan @bhumipednekar Lolol.. Ur so incorrigble man.. Yet total fun to read.
@sapnabhavnani @worldforall @RichaChadha Awww.  Cuties u all.
@kamaalrkhan @iHrithik @iTIGERSHROFF Looks like thugs of hindustan.. If it is as insipid with only fights, and poor screenplay and only herogiri.. Ooof.. Yrf is in big trouble boss.
@pinkvilla Good job pinkville. For covering her
@RanvirShorey Well said boss..  Between two billis; bandar kyo aaya?  üòÜüòÖüòÇ
@Rangoli_A Bless the little boy
@Rangoli_A Oh my.. What a cutie. Missing his locks

@shekarcm2 @saurabh3vedi @GauravPandhi @Uppolice Oh shit up. Not if your life was in danger by these same goons
@anuragkashyap72 Oh god..  Honour killing at bay.. Another dhadak!  Kya hoga iss desh ka..  Get amnesty. For this sweet girl who hasn't done wrong. Power to media and Twitter which helps so much in making things viral..
@WashingKarma @Preethi_Princes @JustinJRao Chup
@karanjohar Indeed.  Good voice
@Preethi_Princes @JustinJRao Oh my god.  This Justin smacks of hatred and venom, media bullying and taking advantage of his power of pen to publish personal opinions randomly, freely wrt to kangana. He is a jinogist and stinks of a hurt lions ego in form of invidious personal attacks.
@Rangoli_A Lolol.  Rolupolu..  Hahahahaha..  Love the open public adjectives.. Hahahha
@kamaalrkhan Absolutely correct. This lady whatever she is.. It's sheer steel and grit and guys without ever cowing and bowing down. Salute to her never die spirit.
@Salman10187534 @Rangoli_A Sahi jawab
@RanveerOfficial @83thefilm @kabirkhankk @deepikapadukone @madmantena @Shibasishsarkar @vishinduri @RelianceEnt @FuhSePhantom @NGEMovies Good job dude
@Rangoli_A @TLLLFoundation Your only problem is. 

You really love interfering in everyones business even when it's not your business.  Revenge, give back is a word that u refuse to let go na?  Just learn to let go and not sweat the small stuff.  Believe me -u will be so peaceful
@Rangoli_A @anuragkashyap72 Yes..  That comment and public scoffing or mockery is not cool.  It reeks of self assuredness at cost or bullets on another.  Imagine th mockery made behind doors.  Have the guts? Call a spade; a spade.  Then laugh.
@kamaalrkhan @itsBhushanKumar Aapki bhavishyavaani sar aakho par..  Wah.. Kya bolbachan hai
@kamaalrkhan What rubbish u talk ya.  Every genre cannot be unequivocally compared?  A hard hitting realistic article 15cant be compared to high voltage action drama or epic drama. Tera sense toh nonsense hai despite u being very entertaining. Lol
@BeingSalmanKhan So cute
@ZairaWasimmm Respect for your decision. And what ever you feel correct.  It takes guys to jettison fame, money your way and resort to things u believe in..  Atta girl
@anuragkashyap72 Aise kyo bolte hain.  Revel in the movie that elevated your status and gave u more recognition..  U did something wow.  And no one gonna forget that in hurry..  Bravo
@Rangoli_A So everyone one who I love takes precedence over family?  I fall in love ( so I think with my ltd braincells)  with a chawl fella, &amp;my family is high bred ; should they give in.?  Wouldn't they drill sense in adult kid of future compatibility?  Don't mess with her man.
@Tara_Deshpande Onions and sev both..
@kamaalrkhan Sahi bola biddu
@pinkvilla Coz he knows it's a flop
@PriyankaCentral @priyankachopra Eeks..  Now that's a bad coverage to bosom.  I can see those little roundel pads.  Faux pas!
@Rangoli_A Okay. So what do u gals want to prove?  That ur sharp shooting, hell raising, whistle blowers?  Check‚àö. Now breathe and live and relax. Don't tax your mind and peaceful living far more imp.  Than raising storms. One day hope u gals realise this
@bollywood_life None
@bainjal He is totally a chowkidar . he more interested in nautanki ramlila style with dialogues matching it. I don't think Congress stands a chance just yet. But I predict modichowkidar gonna return with lesser seats albeit
@bainjal He is sch a bakchhod billi.. Fenku is correct name. Check his smug complacency and wry smile . all our peeve won't do a thing. This kalank is coming back for another term to autocracy. Woe for Indians!
@kamaalrkhan @OfficialUrmila Well said dude

@aliaa08 He is randy awright!! Lol
@KRKBoxOffice Wby are u promoting it soon much ? WhaTs your point
@NGEMovies @kritisanon @abhivarman @karanjohar @WardaNadiadwala Sorry. Very laboured moves. Jerk and pushes and not seamless . yet a decent try
@htshowbiz @aliaa08 She has officially lost it. Mad woman and upgraded. version of rakhi sawant at best.
@ekjugni @pinkvilla and a rude jealous bit**. Don't forget that
@indirasingh28 @pinkvilla I agree. She good actress.but without the x appeal of a deeply or even kaif. Sbe is quite the girl next door and she is being thrust Onto us as the IT GAL.  Bollocks
@navneet_mundhra And she apparently went for maunvrat in search of higher self! Lol. She is no longer bold.she is plain jealous Motormouth with a narcissistic issue . she is axing her own prospects n already a laughing stock with most.

@kamaalrkhan I don't agree with  your deductions but I marvel at your genuine and original thought process and thesis . kya logic hai . wah
@SahilBulla Aisa kya?  Yaani full excuse for soft porn allowed free of censorship on paid subscriptions .
@kamaalrkhan You are so limited as a human with myopic vision . makers of this movie mostly knew they not making a commercial one .its for a targeted audience &amp; enuff appreciators. Chill pls! It will go down in history as a classic . not total dhamaal.
@MS20527728 @thevirdas I think he did correct by not pandering to asses-masses. &amp; stay true to script &amp;belief .India can never hv quality cinema exactly coz we Want jugadu movies . n then  V crib why our movies R not world class .greenbook type movie in India? Public will reject .
@1124NIMRA @Natsecjeff Snipe not ship. Typos thru auto correct. Apologies
@1124NIMRA @Natsecjeff Hmm. Yes also. But coercion n grace ,diplomatic peace initiation could also be a moot factor. Why release video singing hosannas? Did we ask? Why the edits? Neways don't expect abhi to squeal/ships a thing to media even now. Dignity/grace first!
@sreenivasam6 @Mastermind_RS20 @IndiaToday In today's India .we conveniently make fictitious masqueraders as heroes.( bolly ppl,hardik).this man proved his mettle n showed path to youngsters.
@sreenivasam6 @Mastermind_RS20 @IndiaToday Absolutely correct . we have adored him as a unified nation not on his looks 
His ethics,grace ,bravery and poise has commanded respect of the world . why won't we talk of his moushe? That's adored 2.Will v praise chambal daku's moushe?no! only abhi!
@Natsecjeff Its obviously doctored and said to effect in glory of pakky. So many edits?
@dna Look at them lying continuously. Two pilots they claimed earlier . we haven't sent our jet . there was no air strike attack .etc etc 
What wool pulling this? Open liars can be trusted?
@dna Hands down no! They have made promises earlier too but backtracked . next attack happened &amp;they backed off yet again . they r skunky rats who operate stealthy like a choohas. Biting snakes and chameleons

 I am glad it rising higher . but no harm na; in being real and speaking truth.  Panga liya Rani ne, ab bhugto
@Sushmakc7 @pinkvilla Sahi jawab. Its good to Want validation from within industry but if you yourself have panned most; then reap the seeds u sowed. Kangy- deal with it. Plus ur boss.u need ppl support  not  bolly's support.
Stop begging.
@tina19a @pinkvilla Very true . apna self respect bacha rahe. She has had a word against so many of them . had to happen .
@Asif50056563 @bombaytimes Yes they all probably feel it's like putting a hand in tigers den. Kar bhala, and ho bura. They may acknowledge and congratulate but she may taunt too. That fear is always there. Better 2keep mum.
@filmfare @TheAaryanKartik Hope she is the woh. Doesn't at all look like the patni. Too young for that.

@pinkvilla @RanveerOfficial Both. Important to be flexible and capable enogh to fit into characters which he does.
@pinkvilla Think within .maybe you have riled too many for them to finally boycott. Its not good to speak on their lives publicly either.noone likes being pulled for nothing . that apart ,you are gutsy ,strong. Each of u is hypocritical. Part of work profile I guess.

@bollywood_life @RanveerOfficial @deepikapadukone All for trps
@SydneyKishore @pinkvilla So true. Ane I get so. Bugged with sonams monotone, whiny, screechy voice and dialogue style; her voice and actinv comes across as a 8 yr old kid trapped in big body. Eeeks
@BhujunUma @pinkvilla @KamalJain_TheKJ @anky1912 @SrBachchan Frankly it's good go stay away from controversy. Everyone who is not involved needn't give their two cents. Have u heard -" talk less and hear more !" Its wiser plus he isnt directly involved except giving voice .he needn't butt in everywhere man.
@pinkvilla Sara,alia? Ur kidding? Lol. Why u guys so j of kanvana. Leave her alone . she maybe cuckoo but she is far more talented than others . she is a narc but u can't take it away from her. She owned it Like none other . deep is just glamorous in commercial setup.
@pinkvilla Kanvana did very good. But another capable actress who looks powerful too could have been pc
@Bollyhungama @vidya_balan @DirKrish Tu kitna bakta hai. Bak bak ke bimaar ho jayega. U must have heard kang reputation before na. Why u took it up? Negativity wont kill negativity. Rise and be silent. Be graceful
@Arjun58670687 @Golu29 @pinkvilla @KanganaFanClub Total cartoon.that too without having a credibility with public. Jealousy and greed and resentment over a woman taking reins. She couldn't accept the change . its OK to feel bitter but not defame movie after release . very cheap action.
@SethShruti Sholay, caravan movie with asha parekh( it was classic) and no movie ten times. (2-3times)-- jaane bhi do yaaro,rang de basanti,taare zameenpe,3idiots,gangs of wassey, dilchahtahai
@nikita3553 @iFaridoon Yes .I agree . that was lacking for sure. It definitely looked like roles were chopped just to fit dem in somehow .tatya,Nana sahib,peshwa,etc were side dummies w/zero imp.I did feel this bit was lacking sorely
@nikita3553 @iFaridoon Well in movie I could see the focus on badals legs. And they looked wobbly and shaky. They didn't show him dead tho. I liked the movie perse but felt it lacked character development .for sure all the rest looked like sideys.
@ektaravikapoor Congratulations and many celebrations . wish you super innings as momma
@nikita3553 @iFaridoon Badal. Autocorrct sorry
@nikita3553 @iFaridoon But he was shown wobbly and eventually if I have read the book correct and recall well; basal dies . there are many myths wrt to many parts of her life .who knows what is actually correct .badal escapes but dies .ranis hubby was gay too apparently
@nikita3553 @jinaeten @IMishtii @iFaridoon OK.that village song! It made no sense !just to add item song didn't quite match up with the seriousness of topic .yo boss! More emphasis of character building wud've helped better. Tatya etc looked like https://t.co/ibP2BHsMlG
@nikita3553 @iFaridoon Hmmm. Who is dankila BTW? In all this controversy ,i've forgotten the movie .lol.all I recall is kanvana sword scene in front of Kali, n death n fleeing with baby. Baaki forgotten .lol
@nikita3553 @jinaeten @IMishtii @iFaridoon But every scene needn't fit in final scheme of things na? If it doesn't take the moot story forward; showing kashibai bravado takes away screen space and elongates it hugely. Who wants 2c a 3hr movie?I don't
@IMishtii @Rajvee07 Dont be so self centered. Only pr doesn't work. Your destiny,talent luck matter too. Why believe promises when u knew this is kangy outing? Politics my friend exists in all fields .dont be so naive like a bechari.
@IMishtii @iFaridoon By being negative n crying foul openly ; you proved you are a whine and will attack later and sabotage a prospect . shows vindictive outlet. Would u do that if it were aamir, Salman?
@Golu29 @nambiarbejoy @Apurvasrani @Rangoli_A @DirKrish One would think so. He was on high horse for ntr. But it flopped and he returned to claim rights post release of Mani. Not fair. Issue should have sorted b4 release.
@Apurvasrani Its best to file a case na? Why headbang on twitter. And wash Dirty linen in public . doesn't augur well for anyone .
@MissMalini @pallavimanoj94 What crap.most look morphed
@sid_dsk @nikhil01231197 @pv0419 @DirKrish The joker is zeeshan ayub who is renowned as an actor . however, all characters were given a raw deal excepting kangys. If he looked like a joker than whose fault is that? Lil.birdie told me it's a Lady director!
