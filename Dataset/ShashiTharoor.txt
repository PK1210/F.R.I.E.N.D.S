The reorganization of unwieldy large States must be conducted through a comprehensive statutory process, instead of ad hocism or political expediency. A Commission w/experts can take stock of our governance from time to time and recommend changes to the Parliament to consider.
I introduced a Bill today to set up a statutory States&amp;Union Territories Reorganisation Commission, to recommend the reorganization of States based on factors such as administrative efficacy, population,&amp;economic interests. We must cope better w/demands for separate states. https://t.co/XWXhXBg2N5
2/2 The Citizenship Act, 1955 does not allow dual citizenship, but before we can amend the Act, we need to amend Article 9 of the Constitution which places a bar against this concept. Once this Bill is passed by Parliament, we can amend the Act &amp; make dual citizenship a reality.
1/2 Today I introduced a Bill to amend the Constitution of India to allow dual citizenship. We have the largest diaspora in the World, many of whom who have migrated abroad for better opportunities. Taking a foreign passport for convenience does not make them any less Indian. https://t.co/sSyaRPIDUZ
I introduced a Bill today to amend the Constitution, to expressly recognize the Right to Vote as a Fundamental Right. The Bill also recognizes the need to lower the eligible age for elections to 18 years, so as to allow greater representation of young India in our legislatures. https://t.co/yQuaCAG5zb
