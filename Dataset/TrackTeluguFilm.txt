As per current booking statuses, we are expecting somewhere between 45C-50C WW share on day1. If this is happens, Mahesh will emerge as only commercial hero to breach 50C in a single day with regular film, which is almost equal to closing share of B-grade heroes #Maharshi

Content is delivered to distrubutors just this morning.They are convincing Regal  to open once they provide tracking number.Bookings will open mostly on Tuesday at Regal.Shows will begin as per schedules.#maharshi
Huge demand for Maharshi tickets all over AP/TS. Euphoria is slowly catching up irrespective of negative propaganda by certain section of media. Day 1 non BB records confirm in atleast 3 areas as of now.
For the First in the History of Kasi Theatre (4K Dolby Atmos) ..Telugu movie got 5AM show.. Its @urstrulyMahesh’s Prestigious #Maharshi

#MaharshionMay9th
A star hero’s personal PRO paid lakhs to each of his media to cook up stories on #Maharshi. Previously they used to write on indifferences between producers. After realizing their bonding during Pre-release event, they started foul cry on Maharshi business and over budget.
Huge advance bookings all over AP/TS

Big Breaking: KGF director in talks with Mahesh Babu? https://t.co/wjcLRTZfGG
It’s official. 

The collections of #GeethaGovindam is much higher than #AravindaSametha during #MahaShivaratri2019 special fans show. This proves #VijayDevarakonda is bigger star than #JrNTR.
@TFI_no1_SSMB Since, we don’t have much releases and it’s not worth money for tracking low budget movies. We are bit slowed down. Anyways thanks for the compliment, we will try our best.
Reshoots start https://t.co/e4WexD80hN
Eventhough people outrightly rejected #NTRKMahanayakudu, Balayya needs to be appreciated for not faking movie collections unlike another biggie released this Sankranti.

This is what genuinity looks like👏👏
The movie #NTRMahayanakudu which is expected to break #Bahubali records according to @Telugu360, broken #Officer record for least share movie from Star hero.

Point to be noted. Officer’s director is RGV, who already lost his craze. But the combo of Balayya-Krish failed miserably
#NandamuriBalakrishna is the only hero in the world cinema who has given Industry’s biggest hit and zero share movie.

Guess no one can break this unique record.
Nandamuri Family Holds the record for more number of “Zero” share movies.

#NaaNuvve
#NTRMahayanakudu 

Impossible for the distributors to recover the losses.
#NTRMahanayakudu recorded a magnanimous disaster at the BO. 0 housefuls all over AP/TS/KA/OS.

Even Nag-RGV’s #Officer performed better in some areas.
JrNTR is lobbying with his team to unveil his wax statue at Madame Tussaud’s.
Below avg reviews for #NTRMahanayakudu
We wholeheartedly condemn the ghastly attack on our CRPF Javan’s. We request PM Narendra modi and #indianarmy to take strict actions on the culprits behind #PulawamaAttack  #IndiaWantsRevenge

Gossip: after hearing super positive reports for #Yatra, Balayya-Krish scrapped some scenes in #NTRMahanayakudu and changing story to add more emotional content to connect to masses. 👍👍
#Yatra opened with good word of mouth!

Decent openings all over.

2019 Sankranti release #VinayaVidheyaRama closing 23.51Cr (including hires and GST returns)

2013 #RamayyaVastavayya and 2014 #Rabhasa closing &gt;&gt; #VVR

Considering these facts, major credit for RRR goes to Tarak👌👌
#AravindaSametha failed miserably at home box office (TVs). Below par TRPs recorded. 13.7

Though it’s Trivikram’s recent best, no amazon prime or Netflix release, couldn’t made an impact.

Probably NTR should hire strong PR team to get better TRPs.
Without hires,
