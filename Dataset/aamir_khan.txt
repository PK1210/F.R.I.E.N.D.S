Heartfelt thank you to Honorable PM &amp; the Govt of India for considering the request of the film industry for reduction in GST.  If Indian cinema hopes to compete in the world market then we need the support of the Govt &amp; Administration.
This is a great 1st step in that direction.
Thoroughly enjoyed shooting this! Was an absolute pleasure to work with Suresh Triveni and of course @TripathiiPankaj. Big thank you to Aatish and JD for helping me out with the accent!
