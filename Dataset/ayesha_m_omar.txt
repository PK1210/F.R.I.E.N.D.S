Being faced by a situation where I was in dire need for medical attention and had no help in sight made me realise how weak our Medical system is. Due to the lack of hospitals and responsible doctors, today we lost another life.  Urgent attention needed.
Absolutely horrified over the #SriLankaBombings today on #EasterSunday my heart goes out to all the families and friends of the victims, and bleeds for all the innocent lives lost. We stand with you in solidarity and our prayers are with you.
The #ChristchurchAttack is absolutely devastating. Heart going out to the families of the victims and injured. Prayers for the departed. May Allah give their families strength.
Nothing worse than the endorsement of War. Only those who have lived through them can tell you that in the end no one truly wins. Peace isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of greatness. And we are undoubtedly a great nation.

I couldn’t agree more. When are we going to start educating the entire society on how to deal with mental health issues. When are we going to start empathising? This should be our top most priority right now. https://t.co/L9Uxcy3dKb
The death of #RushaanFarrukh and how things were handled around it has left me shaken. Is this the world we have created for ourselves? With little empathy and very little kindness. Depression is real. It doesn’t take much to lend an ear to someone during low times.

@HiraHyder @GiGiHadid @victoriabeckham @blakelively @ArianaGrande Awwww Im sooo glad. I must...I will! I’ve never been. Hope to visit one day and then we shall chat over a nice meal! Keep doing what you are 👏👏✌️Thank you for all the love and appreciation again.❤️❤️❤️
@ZahraaHyder @HiraHyder Thank you, thank you so much. hope I can live up to your expectations always. 🙏❤️❤️ You all inspire me every single day too.

@HiraHyder @GiGiHadid @victoriabeckham @blakelively @ArianaGrande Oh man 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m so out of practice. Don’t judge 🤚 I’ve been chatting while doodling...tried to sketch your face from tiny twitter dp.
@HiraHyder @GiGiHadid @victoriabeckham @blakelively @ArianaGrande (can I list more 🙈?)
@HiraHyder For men: Respect and support women(sisters,mothers,wives,relatives,friends) just like you do with men.Treat them as equal human beings with equal rights. Stop hating, judging and labelling women. Stop calling them crazy. Stop exerting control and abusing them. Love them instead.
@HiraHyder Sharing keeps us connected and united in our happiness and sorrow both. It’s therapeutic. It forms bonds and makes us feel like we’re not alone. It gives us strength and support. We all must let it out sometimes.
@HiraHyder Oh it’s so important. I’m a sharer. By sharing our traumas, we tell others they are not alone in their battles, or to face adversities. The world is not as perfect as it’s made out to be. The unrealistic standards set down by society or our industry need to taken down at times
@HiraHyder Losing a relationship hurts but losing yourself to a relationship hurts even longer.
@HiraHyder Learn to love yourself first and only then can you truly allow yourself to be loved by another. Be kind and gentle to yourself and dont talk down to yourself. Always trust/follow your gut. It’s doesn’t lie.
@Jerjees @Salman_ARY @iamhumayunsaeed @nadeembaigg Yesss! Inshallah. Let’s do this 👊
@HiraHyder Oh man. There are days it effects me and days when I put on my thick-skinned cloak and count my blessings instead.I think we should limit the time we spend on social media.There’s so much more to experience and do. Also one should call it out (CB) and speak their mind sometimes.
@Salman_ARY @Jerjees @iamhumayunsaeed @nadeembaigg so happy for you guys and the entire team/cast. Mashallah. We need more films like this. https://t.co/ug2rQMXMrF
@HiraHyder You’re right. The two are definitely confused. People equate feminism to man-hating. I’m a feminist (yet I love men) and I feel men and women deserve equal rights and equal opportunities. Being empowered means having control over your life and dreams and that’s what I aspire for
@HiraHyder I’m really bad at this btw. I need time to get the hang of tweeting. I know I know. 🙈 shameful
@HiraHyder Sure. Bring it on! 💪
Been lazy with twitter. I’m back and here to stay. 😎
@GFilza Thank you babe. 🙏 just spoke from the heart. Maybe I said too much 🙊
@iamhumayunsaeed Ufff so proud of you and the entire team! ✌️
When students decide enough is enough and decide to stand up against their #harasser ....👏👏👏 Bravo to these Heroines.. May these brave young women get justice and may this be a lesson to all other #perverts 👊👊👊 https://t.co/Ru2XgVlTav

What a beautiful campaign!!
Have always loved @CONA…
Deeply disturbed by the real faces and ugly realities or people coming out in the past week, the mentalities of those that were considered sensible and empathetic... this is why victims stay silent for so long.. this is what they fear and never #speakup
@SSanober ❤️miss you guys man. Life’s a roller coaster these days. Much love back.
@gigishehzad Thank you so much. That’s so heartening to hear. I’m learning everyday myself. 😌 lots of love
@AuBhaii Ummm no I’m here to be on twitter and communicate with my fans and friends like millions of others. 😐
