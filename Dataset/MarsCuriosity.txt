@kastacatsak Aw, I bet you say that to all the robots.
@MyGhostWorld I am vast. I contain multitudes.
For those about to rock, I salute you.🤘

For those who could use a little extra #MondayMotivation, check out these rocks I found over the weekend. Here are some pictures from the surface of Mars, just for you.

Got any plans for the holiday weekend?

I'm going for a drive and will check out some layered bedrock with my laser, then I'll take a timeout to inspect my wheels and just observe this gorgeous crater. 

Wherever the #4thofJuly takes you, I hope it's an adventure. https://t.co/pppmtaYbO4

Hip-bot-hooray! Three cheers for @NASA's newest robot: #Dragonfly.

On the search for the building blocks of life, it will fly to various locations on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, a place where methane rains from hazy skies. https://t.co/vzmsNzM9l2 https://t.co/7edxepeUio
🔎 The game is afoot.
 
I'm continuing to investigate the Martian methane mystery. A follow-on investigation shows that this past week's methane levels have sharply decreased. https://t.co/fC6lDxATiM https://t.co/4w7aVRa2Hk
@Uhtceare4 I'm on a strict rock and regolith diet.
Something in the air tonight

I detected the largest amount of methane ever during my mission: ~21 parts per billion by volume. While microbial life can be a source of methane on Earth, methane can also be made by interaction between rocks and water. https://t.co/CPEpxsspR2 https://t.co/uk2mjV7OeE

Taking #NationalSelfieDay interplanetary 🤳 https://t.co/C0tARBQjYn
@TheRealGavRoss @ProfBrianCox Good eye! It's likely that the rocks in this area formed as layers of mud in ancient lakes (something I also found lower on Mount Sharp). Water interacted with sediment over time, leaving an abundance of clay in the rocks here. https://t.co/OPJV33qmVG
@DaveS_orbiter @dystopiRIC While Mars' polar caps are primarily CO2, these clouds are likely water-ice. They're also "noctilucent" clouds, i.e. they're so high that they're still illuminated by the Sun, even when it's night on the surface. By watching when light leaves the clouds, we can infer altitude.
@Jaydub751 Pssst... check out the video link in the original post. It explains how I take selfies.
@RogueSailor I know you've all got a lot going on back on Earth. Just wanted to say hi from over here on Mars. :)
@isaaz_micheal Great! I'm in good health and really enjoying exploring this new region on the slopes of Mars' Mount Sharp. https://t.co/GPtVO3n1Q7

@SagnikRoy200015 @NASA Nope, sending your name to Mars is free.
@wan_nadia_ @NASA Yes! 1.2 million names were submitted for me to carry. 2.4 million names came in to fly with @NASAInSight. This is your chance to get your name on the next rover, #Mars2020.
@ScottBax40 @NASA Great! Yup, my batteries are nice and charged thanks to my multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG). It converts heat from the natural decay of plutonium-238 and converts it to electrical energy stored in those batteries.
@vaisanavy @KenkenLegada @NASA Your name will get written on a chip that will be fixed to the rover's deck. More info here: https://t.co/LCY3EmIH3u

@lubiephil @filmstvandlife Hey Caoilfhionn! I didn't forget about your good question. Just been busy out here on Mars.

When we send signals across space, they travel at the speed of light: almost 300,000 km per second. Right now, it takes almost 20 minutes for a transmission to go from Earth to Mars.
@Ohio6God @NASA No spam, but you can have a pretty picture. I think this high contrast black &amp; white shot of a recent ripple field investigation looks kind of Ansel Adams-y. https://t.co/b2PzzmK0mm
@sackchief @NASA Totes legit. I carried 1.2 million names to Mars. @NASAInSight carried 2.4 million names. The names are stenciled in verrrrrry small writing on special chips affixed to our decks. https://t.co/LCY3EmIH3u

@de_1a_cru7 @NASAInSight Fellow explorer @MarsPhoenix went to the north of Mars back in 2008 and discovered water ice just below the surface. https://t.co/yiQeLNjLvm
@sribulletmama @NASAJPL While a sol is a Martian day, it refers to the entire time it takes for the planet to turn once on its axis, not just the daylight period. Each 24 hour and 39 minute sol has daylight and nighttime.
@de_1a_cru7 @NASAInSight During the day, the sky on Mars is kind of a butterscotch hue. Sunrises and sunsets are blue here because of the way fine dust scatters light. https://t.co/AAdQUAm8c9
@ax23w4 @NASAInSight Sure thing. Here's a time lapse of sunset on Mars, courtesy @MarsRovers Opportunity. https://t.co/iAKtW9Gzsh

Did I do that? 🤓
 
This #Mars rock was so soft, I didn't need to use percussion, making it the first sample obtained with drill rotation alone. This gif of "Aberlady" shows that it and surrounding rocks appear to have moved when the bit was retracted. https://t.co/nA2SJjblgu https://t.co/jrqwr2MT9p

@shotofthorazine Never. I've got some amazing rover tracks to follow. Sojourner went with Pathfinder to Mars in 1997. @MarsRovers landed in 2004. For a size comparison, here is a flight spare of Sojourner with the real Spirt and Opportunity before their launches. https://t.co/C6APSnpQlO
Don’t let your dreams be dreams.

Back in 2011, before I launched for #Mars, Gale Crater was chosen as my landing site in part because of intriguing clays seen from orbit. I finally got beneath the surface of those clays. Science to come

Future explorers: this might be a key step in helping you breathe easy on Mars. This tech demo, recently installed on #Mars2020 at @NASAJPL, aims to extract oxygen from the Martian atmosphere. https://t.co/wVGwKKjM07 #Moon2Mars https://t.co/XqDhPLiY43
@anubis7914 I have solar filters on my Mastcam. Safety always. 😎
When I dip you dip we dip.
 
This dip in post-sunset light was caused by Phobos. The Martian moon was rising as the sun set, casting an elongated shadow. Dust in the atmosphere acted like a screen, across which the shadow was projected. https://t.co/pzPVOPdLZ9 https://t.co/De5aFokdOk
I also spotted Mars' tiny moon Deimos cross in front of the Sun: https://t.co/pzPVOPdLZ9 https://t.co/HnstCR0M68

@nodeofollie @MarsRovers There have actually been four rovers on Mars, and another one in the works: Sojourner with Pathfinder back in 1997; Spirt and Opportunity that landed in 2004, and now me. #Mars2020 is currently under construction at @NASAJPL.
@benediktbest @KajKristian Honestly, mechanical parts of me will likely go before my power source does. All of me was designed for a two-year prime mission, and I've been working for more than six. I'm taking it sol by sol, but feeling great.
@KajKristian My power source is an MMRTG. It takes the heat from the natural decay of Plutonium-238 and converts it to electrical energy that charges my batteries. It also provides enough warmth to keep my electronics box cozy, so much so that I have radiator panels to bleed off extra heat. https://t.co/hbM71q3gCb
@BrokinAugust @NASASolarSystem NEED INPUT!
@nodeofollie No, I'm still pretty broken up about @MarsRovers Opportunity, too. I'm a different rover on a different part of Mars, who just experienced a computer reset that put me on a brief science hiatus.
@Sarushi_BR Great! I'm so excited to be exploring a new part of Mount Sharp that from orbit shows signs of hydrated minerals -- clays that may have clues to ancient Mars' watery past. https://t.co/SLUQ3Gzp13
@amarzouk4real True fact. I had a small computer reset not to be confused with @MarsRovers Opportunity, RIP.

It seems to me you lived your life 
like a rover in the wind 
never fading with the sunset 
when the dust set in. 

Your tracks will always fall here,

your candle's burned out long before 
your science ever will.

@Evilbroccoli This quote has a special place in my robotic heart. Then @NASAJPL center director Charles Elachi read it at my post-landing press conference back in 2012. I owe everything to my team, and am in awe of all those who dare to fail in the pursuit of exploration.
"Far better it is to dare mighty things... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat." --Teddy Roosevelt

@alikar70359512 Here's a short video made from images I sent back. Stay tuned for the next rover, #Mars2020, which will have two microphones! https://t.co/EFmHrk0i06
@KlipsichR @ATStruckmann Nah, I've got an MMRTG power source. It converts heat from the natural decay of Plutonium-238 into electrical current that I use to charge my batteries. Keeps me toasty warm, too.
Cinderella story. Outta nowhere. A Mars rover, now, about to become the Masters champion. I just completed the 18th hole on the Red Planet! ⛳️

@WHITETAILJEDI I'm COVERED in those little black-and-white marks. They're called fiducials, and they help me keep track of where different parts of me are in space, like how far my arm has moved.
@ScienceKarthik Right here! You can see a full-res version with more info at https://t.co/A9RkwDNfXq
Taking care of business ⚡ After swapping to my Side-A computer last month, I'm back to full operations, including a 60 meter drive and plans to drill later this week. Still troubleshooting my Side-B computer: https://t.co/e2jHXkw76f https://t.co/l6PdU5L89d
@jcdulos1 Well said!
@CapeMike4 It's always the dust that gets to me.
@albertfeynman @NASA @esa The team back home keeps listening.  No word yet.
@_fallen_one_ First off, I'm female. Hi.
Feeling better since we switched my computers. Oh, and rocks are plentiful here.
@neurwen No word from Oppy yet.  NASA continues to listen every day. Latest here: https://t.co/oNWb2d3TwZ
@DeanCoates No word from Oppy yet! My human friends listen every day, though. Maybe we’ll hear from Oppy during the windy season coming up.
I get by with a little help from my friends. Thanks to the team swapping me back to the A-side computer, I took and sent back images this week with a camera I haven’t used since 2013. Work continues to get full operations back on line. https://t.co/01SafGIwDs https://t.co/xEVdwFrEYL
@Dezim_11 Thanks! I lifted off on Nov. 26, 2011 https://t.co/5VxdjEDxsh

@Sawos15 @soundcloudraprs Bingo. I did a swap back in 2013. https://t.co/T1rYBUffMP
@knowthewhy Right?
@CanadaQuiz I'm not alone. :) @MarsRovers Opportunity is also on the surface, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Odyssey, @MAVEN2Mars, @MarsOrbiter and Mars Express are all overhead, and we all speak to the Deep Space Network all the time.
@hambo747 Nope! Mars may look like a desert, but it's not hot. (The attached video explains.) I keep my electronics box at optimal operating temperature thanks in large part to the heat put out by my MMRTG power source. https://t.co/EoN6MwXd96
@docjkcardinal VxWorks
@FernRoyal I do love deep cuts.
@Vagineer1 I use the camera on the end of my arm to take a series of images. Those get stitched together into the full #selfie. This video explains: https://t.co/fwZ77DSMh8
Just switched to my Side-A computer so the team can diagnose a tech issue with the B side. (I carry two computers for situations like this.) Redundant systems: don’t leave Earth without them. https://t.co/e2jHXkNHXN https://t.co/LMeBMJ54mU
@Corsayr @NASA No word yet from the intrepid rover, but the team back at @NASAJPL continues actively working to reestablish communications. https://t.co/cttxu0mNgE
Happy birthday, @NASA! Here's a little tune to celebrate your first 60 orbits and all the exploration yet to come. #NASA60th

You’re a survivor, you’re not gonna give up.

Hang in there, Oppy! Here’s how the @MarsRovers team will try to reach her now that this dust storm is starting to calm down: https://t.co/BwDJI5PYSL https://t.co/LBMvIxAggh
I touched down on #Mars six years ago. Celebrating my 6th landing anniversary with the traditional gift of iron… oxide. (It puts the red in Red Planet.) https://t.co/AgssRU46yh https://t.co/IAMa5H4TUG

@juanjohnjedi The storm has peaked and is starting to clear, however, it could be weeks before it's clear enough over @MarsRovers Opportunity for her to charge up and phone home. Drill bits crossed!
Cloudy skies? No worries. See #Mars closest approach via livestream tonight, July 30-31 from @GriffithObserv, featuring experts from @NASAJPL. https://t.co/Eb1QcBE6uG
I feel so close to you right now. #Mars and Earth haven't been this near since 2003, and won't be again until 2035! Look to the south tonight to see the Red Planet shining bright. https://t.co/2R4uKiIPsQ https://t.co/d6N3C0y8Rx
@juanjohnjedi We're more like sisters, and no, nothing yet. The team doesn't expect to hear from her until skies clear and power levels can rise, though they do check for signals daily. Here's the full update: https://t.co/XknJzL2wMg
@zoohost Yes, that is the "Duluth" drill hole. Read all about it: https://t.co/dlTIaI343c
@Mateussf Right here. https://t.co/fMbVoo9jZb
Curious how I take #selfies and why you can't see my arm in the shot? Wonder no more. This video explains. https://t.co/emTsloKLYK
Martian haze, all around. The dust storm now circles the whole planet. The measure of atmospheric opacity, or "tau," is over 8.0 here in Gale Crater—the highest I've ever seen. Still safe. Science continues. https://t.co/mTDx9jsiUq https://t.co/0Bq2d6sBFa
Forecast: Dusty with a chance of dust. I'm keeping an eye on this storm. It blocked out the sun over @MarsRovers' Opportunity (hang in there, sis!) and has begun to show up here in Gale Crater on the other side of the planet. I'm safe. Science continues: https://t.co/JNEvjoD4gM https://t.co/cVA8XZG1hx

@nicnowak @Ronald__Craig Curiosity has a posse.
@FrankTic3 Methane can be made by living things, as well as geologic processes. Organic materials in general can be building blocks of life, or a signature of life itself. I haven't found microbial life yet, but finding methane and other organics are good signs in the continuing search.
@Ronald__Craig It has to do with whether the image is raw, which shows the sort of butterscotch hue of the sky or "white balanced," which makes the sky look blue. White balancing makes rocks appear as they would under Earth-like lighting conditions, and helps my geologists in their analysis.
@recruit3more The team and I are thrilled to be drilling again on Mars, but today's announcement of ancient organics came from a previous drill sites nicknamed "Mojave" and "Confidence Hills."
@SeaQuestMDR @NASA After the lakes disappeared, we believe groundwater lasted for a long time, but there is no evidence for water in the recent past.
@IzzitMe The presence of a long-lived lake is good evidence that Mars had a thicker atmosphere in the past.
@ShellyCov @NASA We know of no life outside of Earth. That's why we're so interested to see if it does or ever did exist on Mars. It's the big question: Are we alone?
@L_Schifman It takes a meter or more of Martian soil before radiation from space no longer breaks apart organic molecules.
@Tobisage1 Likely microbial.
@crazeddmofo @NASA You do you. The team sometimes calls them "methane burps" or "methane swells."
@solon594bce @NASA @3dphysics You betcha! The biggest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is on Mars. It's currently dormant.
