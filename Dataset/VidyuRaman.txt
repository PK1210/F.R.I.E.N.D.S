#Sarrainodu is my biggest hit in Telugu and a film that changed my career graph. Zero fat jokes. Raju Gari Gandhi was a small scale hit. Zero fat jokes. Tholi Prema no fat jokes. I can name soooo many films that didn’t pick on my size. Change is slow but sure. 👍🏼
Thank you @ChaiBisket for this.. really flattered. I do see cinema changing, we still have a long way to go as far as comedy in general is concerned.
