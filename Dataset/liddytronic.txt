@sharkle82 @sovietblobfish I mean just in general i assume the military leadership of a nation was at least clever enough to not think that Belgium is made of lava
@sharkle82 @sovietblobfish I don‚Äôt know enough about the battles of World War II but who‚Äôs to say it wouldn‚Äôt have been worse for everybody if the Germans could have just waltzed right across the France/Germany border
@sharkle82 @sovietblobfish But you can force the enemy to cross in a place they‚Äôd prefer not to or you can delay their crossing
@sharkle82 @sovietblobfish Slows them down so you can mobilize your troops to wherever they are. This is an era where you basically couldn‚Äôt build fortifications strong enough to hold against the bombs your enemy had indefinitely. We still can‚Äôt. Impenetrable fortifications haven‚Äôt existed since pre-wwi
@sovietblobfish @sharkle82 Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting at defense are more about delaying than outright stopping in that era of warfare
@sharkle82 @sovietblobfish I‚Äôd argue the point is so you can‚Äôt go through it
@sharkle82 @sovietblobfish ‚ÄúJust‚Äù go around it is describing what an army has to do when it faces an impenetrable defense. You‚Äôll note he didn‚Äôt go through it

@pixeljadeart our generation has new offensive words and they're actually harmful words like slurs
@pixeljadeart like i could. i do it at work. i just wouldn't. out of spite.

the cuss window has shifted and it's stupid to be offended by words like fuck and ass. It's the puritanical bent of older generations are why those words are considered offensive.
@pixeljadeart like if i'm being totally honest, if somebody has a problem with swearing they would not wanna live with me because i would not adjust that behavior for anybody lmao
