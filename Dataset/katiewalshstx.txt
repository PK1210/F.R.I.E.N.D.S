@rSark @TribuneAgency On the micro scale, it's fascinating, what's frightening is the much bigger picture stuff. Bye-bye, free and fair elections!
Here‚Äôs my fan-casting for THE GREAT HACK narrative adaptation: 

Naomi Watts as Carole Cadwalladr 
Morgan Saylor as Brittany Kaiser
Chris Messina as David Carroll
Nicolas Hoult as Christopher Wylie
Paul Bettany as Alexander Nix
I love that THE GREAT HACK is paced and edited like a political espionage thriller. It‚Äôs so important to understand for our civil rights and future elections, but it‚Äôs also just a super entertaining movie.
THE GREAT HACK (7/24 on Netflix) should be required viewing for every American citizen. This unpacking of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica/Trump election is frightening, &amp; everyone needs to delete Facebook before the 2020 election  My @TribuneAgency review
