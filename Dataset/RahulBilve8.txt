If you think you have a bad luck, @rogerfederer  won 6 games in each set, won more overall games and won more overall points and yet he lost the match. It doesn't matter Legend. You keep your head high up. It's a privilege to see you play. #Wimbledon
Oh my god!! How did I forget 13 July!!! 7 years ago, I saw a movie which literally changed the life of many people including mine! Also the songs are so amazing that they are still in my playlist.

Dear @hazardeden10

I literally have tears in my eyes while tweeting this. All I want to say is, I instantly became your fan when I saw this goal. It's because of you I seriously started following Chelsea. It was pleasure to see you play for Chelsea. 1/2

@dhairya_chheda I know! I have 0 expectations from the final episode. But I'm a hopeful person. I'm still hoping that they'll somehow just manage to justify their writing.
Honestly they've ruined the entire season in the name of "Suprise" &amp; "Wow" factor. I have no idea what to expect from the final episode. Though I've lost all the hope, I'm still hopeful they'll amend the things &amp; give the ending which fans deserve. (Highly unlikely.) (3/3) #GotS8
Jaime's journey of redemption.

Cersei's death at the hands of a main character.

Tyrion's wit &amp; smartness.

Sam's knowledge by reading the books.

Fuzz about the golden company.

And all of these ended in Season 8 as if they never existed. 

This is so not acceptable!!!! (2/3)
So we've seen the 7 seasons of #GameOfThrones building up the following:

White walkers threat to humanity.

Arya's faceless men capabilities.

Bran's three eyed raven powers.

Jon's fighting &amp; persuasive skills.

Dany's love &amp; concern for innocent people of the realm. (1/3)
