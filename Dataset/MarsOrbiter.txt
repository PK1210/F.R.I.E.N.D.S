Bidding farewell to the one who led me up to this planet. It was an honour to be a part of your team Dr Radhakrishnan.
Phew! Experience of a lifetime. Watched the #MarsComet #SidingSpring whizzing past the planet. I'm in my orbit, safe and sound.
@isro A mountain three times as tall as Mount Everest, a canyon, nine times as long as the Grand Canyon.
Did you see that? It moved! Oh, it's just Phobos. https://t.co/vaY7w5JjW0

One week on Mars and picture makes it to @TIME ! #feelingproud
Lovely chatting with you @CanberraDSN ! You are a great listener, especially when I go all sciency.
What sorcery is this? Get your 3D glasses to look at Mars the way I do! http://t.co/eWBN7MaBMS
@RifatJawaid Hey smart little one! The place looks a lot like home with the icy poles, peaks, caves, canyons and dust storms. Way to go!
Something's brewing here! http://t.co/ecX1t6onXp
Awesome!  @ESA_Rosetta, snack time selfie with Mars? This thing doesn't have a front cam :(
Thank you @elonmusk. All the best for your Mars plans! It'll be nice to have a little bit of home here.
@esaoperations Party at #ISS.
@Moskvaa Back when they were assembling my computers, selfie was not a word in the @OxfordWords .
@esa @ISRO Thanks! @ESA_Rosetta seems quite busy with the excursion to the new orbit.
The bravest of us all @NASAVoyager, having ventured out the farthest. We're here for you.
@narendramodi @isro  Thank you Hon’ble PM. As you said yesterday, "Let us push our boundaries. And then, push some more!"
@Raheelk I wish i could :( Send me a mirror in the next flight.
Wow! Your pic made my day. Excited to have an explorer buddy.@esaoperations
@sachi_bbsr 8449 km.
A shot of Martian atmosphere. I'm getting better at it. No pressure. http://t.co/A27s34q5AD
The view is nice up here. http://t.co/VmAjNI76lm
Howdy @MarsCuriosity ? Keep in touch. I'll be around.
I’ll be back after breakfast. Good ol’ sunlight. It’s good for your battery.
What is red, is a planet and is the focus of my orbit? http://t.co/HDRWjOcPus
