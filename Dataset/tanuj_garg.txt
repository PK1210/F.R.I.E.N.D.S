Hope everyone in #Timesquare #NewYork is safe. Heard about some helicopter incident. Someone confirm?
#PIA spokesperson says a woman opened the door of a plane, thinking it was a toilet, when it was on the runway in #Manchester. 

A) You cannot open a #B777 door with a button. There is a monster latch for that. 

B) Was the cabin crew snoozing?

Heavy showers expected in #mumbai tomorrow, according to the MET. 

False alarm or rainy day holiday? What say? 

#Monsoon #Monsoon2019
Such a nuisance to have to take a longer route via S.V. Road coz of the closure of Juhu Tara Road near SNDT. 

With the #Monsoon around the corner, doesn't look like the repair work will be done for at least another month or two.

An accomplished actor, director and playwright, #GirishKarnad passed away this morning. 
The intelligentsia is swiftly disappearing from our midst!
One news channel blames #Pakistan for the extreme heat wave in #India.

Another alleges that aliens have abducted the missing #IAF jet. 

We're briskly scaling new-found levels of idiocy.
Arresting scribes for anti-Establishment views is a dangerous violation of the spirit of democracy and freedom of expression/press. THIS NEEDS TO STOP.

Okay, so the #Monsoon has hit the #Kerala coast. Not long before it hits #Mumbai and the happy rain-fies start going up.

Unfortunate. 

From July 1, Govt. to collect 'Aviation Security Fee' of Rs. 150 per passenger on domestic flights. Currently flyers pay Rs. 130 as 'Passenger Service Fee.'

Which means tickets will get costlier.

10 days, still no network at home courtesy of @VodafoneIN @VodafoneGroup. The dolts have been struggling to set up a mobile tower in the vicinity which got shut down without their knowledge!!!üòÑ

Smarties, ensure you don't charge me rental. This tweet is a deemed confirmation.
.@icc flexing muscle without reason. 

@msdhoni plays for the country, not for the ICC or BCCI. 

Asking him to remove the #Army insignia on his gloves, is in fact, disrespectful to the spirit of  bravery and sacrifice by our armed forces.

A 2.5 year old Hindu girl, Twinkle Sharma, is raped by one, Mohammed Zahid, who gouged her eyes, mutilated her body, and poured acid on her.

Why the silence? Should this not be the biggest story? Should the miscreant not be hung in public?

I was among the many who had slammed MLA #BalramThawani for humiliating a woman.

Today I see a #pic of that woman tying a rakhi to the man who slapped her and kicked her in full public view. 

If this isn't disgusting, shameless and non self-respecting, then what is? https://t.co/QG8oHp4RtB

Mum was in #Delhi for the day yesterday. She returned to #Mumbai relieved, saying the heat here was "normal".

Brands need to think twice before sponsoring the glut of ground events(mostly vacuous awards to felicitate "celebs" IF they attend)by media houses.

Last #Saturday three such events took place concurrently in the city.

Here's the @British_Airways #Dreamliner arriving from #London in #Islamabad this morning, after more than a decade.

BJP MLA Balram Thawani publicly slapping and kicking a woman is despicable, disgusting and unpardonable. The video made me cringe, especially hearing her scream. 

How can women be safe till demons like Thawani are not jailed for good?

SCARY!

300 #Boeing Max and NG jets could have certain improperly manufactured parts (leading edge slat tracks), making them susceptible to failure: FAA

6 days without network at home. @VodafoneIN 's neighboring mobile tower is destroyed. All we get are courtesy calls,tweets&amp; visits from different idiots who repeat the problem but have NO solution. Sorry @VodafoneGroup, we're not going to paying the rental! And it's time to port!
