@kimmaicutler @shane_bauer I remember talking to a realtor here in the East Bay after the 2008 crash. While distraught that he wasn't making any commissions, he was reassured that income was going up on his rental properties, because so many foreclosed homeowners were entering the rental market.

@kimmaicutler A white homeowner on the block had already let them do so. There were black homeowners to either side of me with better lines of sight to the house in question -- AFAIK, the cops never asked them.
@kimmaicutler When I moved a few blocks to South Berkeley, one of the first people to welcome me to the neighborhood was an undercover BPD officer, who asked to  set up a camera at my place to surveil the house across the street.
@kimmaicutler When I was in North Oakland, neighbors on the block organized a mass small-claims action against the owner of a house whose grandkids were dealing out of the ground floor. An explicit goal was to force the owner to sell. OPD dispatched an officer to testify in the proceeding.
@kimmaicutler But I've lived within a few blocks for 20 years, and there's a well-established practice of police working with (mostly white) neighbors to target perceived (mostly black-owned) drug houses through code enforcement, small claims nuisance suits, etc. It's policing by other means.
@kimmaicutler I'm sure if you questioned the officer who called in code enforcement, they'd say they have a duty to report obvious violations.
@kimmaicutler The police were doing a drug search targeting Mr  Powell's grandson, who they arrested the same day but never charged.

@ShaneDPhillips 3. That in extreme cases the market's speccing units for HNW buyers who won't actually live in them, but hold them as investments, cash shelters, or pied a terres, thus defeating the purpose of adding supply.
@ShaneDPhillips 2. That developers get higher margins building bigger units with nicer finishes and better amenities in the building targeted to a wealthier clientele. Which can lead to a claim that the market's making bad moves wrt urban design (less dense, more wasteful, "vertical McMansions")
@ShaneDPhillips 1. That the market prices new units beyond the reach of most ppl, so don't count on market actors to fix the affordability crisis for most ppl. (Doesn't logically lead to "so don't build anything," but often gets deployed that way).
@ShaneDPhillips I think there are 3 arguments that get muddled together:
@tbreisacher Yerp
@anniefryman Coffee. Shit tons. Morning only.
@dillonliam Did you disaggregate age and race? (Curious if the age effect is stronger than the race effect -- which is hard to infer bc older Californians are also a much much whiter cohort than younger californians).
@aurabogado @ZivaBranstetter Soooooo deserved!
-The proposal includes ~$5k affordable units
-Target level of affordability (affordable to whom?): unspecified
- Total subsidy per affordable unit, if all $250m cash goes into 5k affordable units: $50k/unit.
-Building homes will require local gov't to re-zone
-(Which could make Google a bundle in land value) 
-This forces a debate over towns with huge tech campuses barring dense development to accommodate the workers.
-(Also: put "company town" on your council debate bingo card)
Highlights:
-$750m of the $1bn is in the form of land
