I love James Cagney's snappy dancing and patter in Footlight Parade @tcm 4 PM and Busby Berkeley's extravaganzas (other than the shameful Shanghai Lil), but the plot line of the rehearsal-studio lockdown plays like an anti-union justification of Triangle Shirtwaist practices.

@mikeystall Sixth grade.
@wellsoliver @emilynussbaum OK; I misheard "she's got a ticket to ride" as "she's got a chicken to ride," but I was seven; heard Monk's Music at fifteen, an age at which one should know the altos from the tenors.
@emilynussbaum When I first heard the album Monk's Music, I mistook Gigi Gryce for Coleman Hawkins and vice versa, because 1. I didn't know that an alto sax is higher than a tenor, and 2. I thought that Coltrane's sound was closer to that of the higher-pitched instrument.
@ElizabethKateri One of the best movies of recent years, plural, and not yet streaming or on disk.
@xlorentzen I haven't; thanks for the heads-up.

Actually, one thing: one line of dialogue may offer a slogan to somebody's Campaign 2020: "We're going to beat those pin-headed lizard shits."
the tiny environmental subplot is stuck on like a Post-It; the only symbolic element is the resuscitation, too little too late and undeveloped. A numbingly literal movie.
Crawl is unintentionally hilarious: whenever an alligator appears, it looks like a person in a gator suit; Aja gives actors four expressions: furrowed brow, wide-eyed gaze, howl of pain, growl of purpose; the backstory is flip and banal; only the looters' tale has wit;...
@MetrographNYC "(Harvard’s squad included a Vietnam vet and a member of the S.D.S.) to the sexual revolution (the men reminisce about the change in mores that resulted from the Pill). The result is a fascinating feat of cultural archeology." -30- (short blurb seems very long in tweets)
@MetrographNYC "“Doonesbury” comics. The story has a hero (Harvard’s second-string quarterback, Frank Champi) and a villain (Yale linebacker Mike Bouscaren), and the game’s action, which is exciting on its own terms, connects with the personal and public passions of the day, from politics
@MetrographNYC "with many of the game’s now-middle-aged participants—including Tommy Lee Jones, a Harvard guard and Al Gore’s roommate; Bob Livingston, a Yale tackle and George W. Bush’s roommate; and Yale quarterback Brian Dowling, nicknamed God and immortalized as B.D. in Garry Trudeau’s
@MetrographNYC " they met in the season’s final game, played in Cambridge, which proceeded according to expectations, until the last minute, when Yale blew a 29–13 lead. Rafferty intercuts the original television broadcast of the game (called by Don Gillis) with lively talking-head interviews
@MetrographNYC "Sports may not always be a metaphor for life, but in Kevin Rafferty’s refreshingly austere documentary, about a legendary 1968 college football game, it comes off as a surprisingly meaningful part of it. Yale’s team was famous, Harvard’s unheralded, but both were undefeated when

The 1965 blackout felt apocalyptic, because it was a new experience and so widespread. But, because we lived in a city building with gas ranges, the festive part was neighbors broiling and sharing all the meat in their refrigerators and freezers.

@lynnsheltonfilm @NewYorker @marcmaron Too kind; very grateful for word—and for the movie.
The insult and injury to Andrea Arnold is awful enough in itself; it's also emblematic of the thin gold plating of the Golden Age of TV: to conform her distinctive work to the "style" of Jean-Marc Vallée is like transcribing music to the key of zero.

I was shocked by that essentializing riff in The Farewell on the difference between the East and the West—"In the East, a person's life is part of a whole"—it struck me as an odd bit of propaganda, suggesting that Asian people don't really want or need democracy and human rights.

@BilgeEbiri @scottrenshaw Isn't the joke that it's easier to control lions than artists?
"Seven producers signed the original articles, Charles Chaplin, Walt Disney, Samuel Goldwyn, Alexander Korda, Mary Pickford, David O. Selznick, and Walter Wanger." Orson Welles became the eighth, in 1942.
Historical irony: Walt Disney was among the founders of the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers, in 1941, which pushed for the lawsuit, U.S. v. Paramount, that broke up the vertically-integrated studios: https://t.co/SzwJEOpBYt
Alongside @GuyLodge on Disney swallowing competitors (antitrust review on Fox purchase?), I wonder about vertical integration—is Disney's streaming service (and Netflix's production) akin to when studios owned theatres (and were then barred from doing so)? https://t.co/AQWLSSrI9h

Ari Aster's Midsommar, with no characters beyond the plot, no plot beyond the images, and no images beyond the effects, displays above all the myth of directorial control: the movie gets away from him: https://t.co/gaLv7l9Yvj
A reminder that three-quarters of Elaine May's directorial oeuvre is playing @FilmForumNYC is a reminder of the films that she didn't get to make—and of the warped priorities of producers active when she made three masterworks in the span of five years.
@MJSchulman Looks like it; an insipid wink at a powerful scene (Mazursky gives viewers the shock of connection by having the actors stare into the camera-eye).
Terribly sorry to learn of the passing of Milos Stehlik, whose work with Facets was crucial to the recognition and appreciation of movies in the U.S.; I spent a busy day with him about ten years ago and was thrilled and graced by his knowledge, passion, and generosity.
Hélas pour moi, a.k.a. Oy Vey Iz Mir, @MetrographNYC 1:15; to build a trilogy, Hail Mary is the New Testament, Nouvelle Vague is the Old and New Testaments, and Hélas pour moi is the Old Testament.
@FCardamenis Not usually; tonight, just for a change.
At the ballpark with First-Born Child. https://t.co/t24PHBmmW0
@FCardamenis @NeilBahadur Bazin is a great critic with the disadvantage of having a theory that revealed some films but stood like a curtain in front of others. Also, he thought like a critic, his young acolytes thought like filmmakers.
@NeilBahadur I wonder how accessible silent movies were other than at the Cinémathèque. He did contend that the advances of the early forties were a restoration of silent-film styles.
@MrGlinis One after the other. So Godard said at the time; so Charles Bitsch, who worked on both, told me; and so the press reported at the time. But there were apparently a few days of overlap where both were being shot.
not knowing his way around and not wanting to risk being late, got to the building at 8:30 and, rather than going in, decided to walk a few blocks and get a cup of coffee.
I had the honor of meeting Pierre Lhomme, in Paris, in 2002, in the street, after a movie; we happened to be at the corner and just started talking; when he heard that I'm from New York, he told me that he was here on 9/11—he had a 9 A.M. meeting in the World Trade Center and,
Pierre Lhomme's cinematography on Chris Marker's musically and conceptually thrilling La solitude du chanteur de fond (about Yves Montand's concert for Chilean refugees after the coup), offers some of the best images of performance that I've seen; it could count as co-direction.
"That was no problem for Pierre Lhomme, who, in preparing for Le Joli Mai, forced himself, for the month before the shoot, to live at home with a camera constantly on his shoulder, in order to familiarize himself physically with the cumbersome device."
In memory of Pierre Lhomme, whose historic cinematography on The Mother and the Whore is inseparable from his co-direction of Le Joli Mai. Luc Béraud, Au travail avec Eustache: "Without grip equipment, the long backwards travelling shot would be done with a hand-held camera...
@afterglow2046 @faceyouhate Haven't read it; de Baecque and Herpe say Cordier was his landlady's last name but aren't sure that's the reason.
@faceyouhate @afterglow2046 Stupid me: Éric Rohmer, who, under the name Gilbert Cordier, published the novel Élisabeth in 1946.
Disturbing moment: as I was preparing to do some exercise, this song from the ancient world came to mind:  https://t.co/6oKPnttdzC
And see Bazin's exquisite irony: "When it reaches its equilibrium profile, the river flows effortlessly from its source to its mouth and stops digging its bed any further." He contended that movie then improved, thanks to Welles, Wyler, and others digging deeper.
Whenever 1939 is cited as Hollywood's greatest year, put a metaphorical coin in André Bazin's tip jar: "In 1939 the talking picture reached what geographers call the equilibrium profile of a river." 1/2

@dave_kehr Not sure that it needs to be either/or; a good print or a good negative would still seem lived-in, not pristine.
@Nick__Desmond When it's inevitable, DCP is fine, but I think of its faux perfection as another kind of flaw, and one that's harder to overlook.

@Honors_Zombie The Last Laugh.
The 35mm print of A Man Escaped reminded me how important is the dust and the scratches, and the crackle of the optical track; a print is an object, and digital preservation should preserve that physicality, not pretend to bring the movie back to a primally pristine state.
@AlmondButters The one I listen to most often after that is Alhambra; then, At the Blackhawk; then, Outertimeinnerspace (he plays electric piano on one track, ringingly and glitteringly).
Saw A Man Escaped @AnthologyFilm remembered that Ishtar is playing @FilmForumNYC and imagined Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman in a remake of Bresson's film. ("If my mother could see me now.")
If CDs had grooves, I'd have worn out my Mosaic box of Jamal's Argo recordings—and also his live-at-Montreux pairing, Outertimeinnerspace and Freeflight (I love his unleashed torrential solos of that later trio, too).
Happy 89th birthday to Ahmad Jamal, who, with a quiet virtuosity, set two grand new jazz paradigms—turning a piano trio into a virtual big band of intricate orchestrations; and soloing with a sense of space to mesh with, and leave room for, the orchestrated rhythms and harmonies.
The wonderful @gelgud MOMA-Gramercy 2003 reminiscence (on home turf) reminds me: that July 4, First-Born Child and The Little Princess joined me there at a screening of The Last Laugh; I loved that theatre, too, and hoped that MOMA would keep it going. https://t.co/gEJq8lufOS

@mattzollerseitz @CraigatPorlock but when they find interviews with directors like Ulmer, they give up. I am for the politique des auteurs, but not just anybody. Opening the door to absolutely everyone is very dangerous. Inflation threatens." The critics he was "subtweeting" were up to something different.
@mattzollerseitz @CraigatPorlock I think that there's some history behind the "vulgar auteurism" idea; see the 1962 Godard interview "when one goes abroad one meets people who say, 'Do you really think Freda is important?' It was difficult enough getting them to see that people like Ray and Aldrich had genius,
