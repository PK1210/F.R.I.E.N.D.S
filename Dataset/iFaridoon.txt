I haven't seen anything like #NubraValley in my life. The #ColdDesert was a revelation. The sand was hot, there were camels yet it was surrounded by tall mountains that had specks of snow. 

Here are my memories of this amazing valley!

After acclimitsing and sorting out the low oxygen issue, we headed to #HemisValley on the 2nd day.We participated in the #HemisValleyFestival.V later headed to #SecmolCampus, the inspiration behind Rancho's school in #3Idiots. A day well spent. 

Highlights :)

Here's the second edit. All the videos and moments at #Khardungla the second highest motorable road in the world. The lack of oxygen, the beautiful scenery, the mountain river. .it's all there edited nicely :) 

Enjoy!

@MrVijayVarma Kudos bro..very nice performance...we need to meet again!!
RT @MrVijayVarma: It does! I‚Äôm a witness and a  propagator of this.. fiercely. Thank u @iFaridoon üå∏‚ù§Ô∏è#super30 https://t.co/uI5cNJATGw
.#Super30 is a great film that must be watched by students, parents and people invested in the education 'business'.

As @MrVijayVarma rightly says,education doesnt merely change the fortunes of families,it impacts the lives of scores of people in a +ive manner

Don't miss it!
The hope,the pride,the sense of loss,the stoic optimism,the genius madness,the tryst with sense of humour,the laid-back body language..@iHrithik is simply mind-blowing. 

HR masterfully plays a hero whose mind is much more effective than the size of his biceps. 

#Super30
One question that rings in your mind after watching @iHrithik 's incredibly honest performance is that bro why don't you grace the silver screen at regular intervals .

It's such a privilege to watch the hard work and diligence that HR puts into becoming Anand. 

#Super30
Aditya Shrivastav makes for an unconventional villain and he shines. 

Pankaj Tripathy adds value to any and every project that he's a part of. Here too he's in superlative form in every single scene.

Actress who played Anand Kumar's mom leaves a mark. 

#Super30
Mrunal Thakur makes her presence felt in all her portions. She also brings in a few hearty laughs. 

Virender Saxena has delivered his career best performance. You've seen him in many films n tv shows. You'd feel like celebrating him after watching him in #Super30
Mathematics has been presented in a relatable manner. The audience connects with the simple teaching methodology of Anand Kumar. You'd witness one of the most unusual fight sequences in Hindi films ever. And yes you'd clap loudly and root for the heroes. 

#Super30
The casting of the 30 kids is brilliant. They look poor, under confident and yet have a dream in their eyes. Education for them is not an option. It's everything. A girl is running away 4m a father who beats her mother. All the stories are heart wrenching and real! 

#Super30
The screenplay of #Super30 ensures that it ends up as an engrossing film that entertains and makes you think at the same time. You'd laugh, cry, marvel and also get angry. 

Vikas Bahl has woven the story very nicely by tugging at your heartstrings right till the end.
Director Vikas Bahl, writer Sanjeev Dutta and Hrithik Roshan have made a very important film,a film that makes Teaching emerge as a superhero profession. 

A film that highlights the crass class divide and why excellence can harness the lives of several generations
#Super30
All set to watch #Super30 with Aarefa who's a fantastic teacher :) https://t.co/2giGRiwYHq
@anubhavsinha Thanks Bhai :)
RT @anubhavsinha: Lovely running in to you to bro. I love your travel zeal. https://t.co/7GkPapmGQO
It was wonderful meeting @anubhavsinha Bhai on the flight 4m #Srinagar to #Mumbai 2day.He's thrilled with the success of #Article15. Saturday BO collections were double than Friday. 

I'm really keen to find out what he does next with his @taapsee starrer. 

Greatness suits him!
