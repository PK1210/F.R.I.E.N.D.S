Saw a stunning life changing Irish film #Rosie which opens this Friday everywhere not in India. Here they only dump trash from world cinema while the true masterpieces like God's Own Country and  Rosie get left behind.

#HrithikRoshan captures the ethos of Bihar in his remarkably astute performance in #Super30. @iHrithik doesn't   'play' Anand Kumar. He enters Anand's soul and captures his essence
#Super30 every Indian should see this wonderful inspirational story of a mathematician who could work magic with numbers. This film will work its own magic with numbers. Take a bow, @iHrithik

#AnabelleComesHome ...I mean seriously? Why is American garbage being spewed into our theatres? What happened to quality control on imports? O stars. See #Article15 or #noblemen instead
The performances in #Article15 don't look like performances at all .The actors don't act.@ayushmannk of course and then #MohammedZeeshanAyub, Kumud Mishra,#ManojPahwa, #AshishVarma, @sayanigupta... Each a muted marvel
'For anyone who has ever felt the pangs of growing up #Noblemen is a must see. The rawest most brutal  and disturbing coming-of-rage Indian film I've ever seen.' 4 stars.

'@shahidkapoor's #KabirSingh the film has excellent pre release reports
As a big fan of #ArjunReddy I can't wait to see what director #SandeepVanga has done to it in the Hindi remake #KabirSingh. Is  @shahidkapoor as intensely contumacious as #VijayDeverkonda @ashwinvarde #vinodbhanushali
'#Leila is a powerful persuasive treatise on a land society and politics fixated on cultural 'purity'.its dystopian depiction of moral dereliction will haunt you for a long time' 4 stars. @humasqureshi @NetflixIndia #deepamehta
'#GameOver ...a gripping heart-in- the-mouth thriller that will make you jump out of your seat.this is @taapsee 's own  Wait Until Dark and she gives #AudreyHepburn a panic run for her money.'4 stars.
#Hrithikroshan's Bihari accent in Super 30 makes me cringe.Has he heard #JoshOConnor's Yorkshire accent in God's Own Country? So authentic they had to put English subtitles
Game far from over for @taapsee  in fact it's just started for this game changing actress.Cant wait to see what she has done in #GameOver
Got an exclusive sneak into @ZEE5Premium's new series #Kaafir. set in militant Kashmir it is powerful and hardhitting with @deespeak at her incandescent best probably among the best things done on the web in recent times https://t.co/iVsPogaV0v
Director #FrancisLee is such a liar.He claims #GodsOwnCountry  is his feature  debut  Ha https://t.co/4gmhrqgG3P can a filmmaker capture those undulating cadences of subtle sensual symphony in his first film?
'#JoshOConnor in #GodsOwnCountry  is the most striking breakthrough performance I have seen .he reminded me of #MarlonBrando in A Street Car Named Desire.
Saw this amazing British film #GodsOwnCountry probably one of the best films I have seen in my life.Young actor #JoshOConnor is a revelation.His character transforms emotionally and physically in front of us. Never seen anything like this

'#Bharat a lucidly agilely sketched portrait of a man and a nation ,completes the @BeingSalmanKhan trilogy of heartfelt performances after Tere Naam and Sultan.Stormy,dramatic and glamorous, Bharat is every bit a winner.' 4 stars
Why is #KaranOberoi in jail?
What is this fuss about #SiddharthChaturvedi dubbing for #ChrisHemsworth? Is that even worth mentioning? Why dont we write about Mayur Vyas who has dubbed the Tamil lines of #Rajinikanth into Hindi in many films?
Saluting @vivekagnihotri for the success of The #TashkentFiles. It takes courage to make a  film on a  controversial political subject .To make a success of it is not short of a miracle
#SalmanKhan jokes when he says #Katrinakaif should win the National award for Bharat.But those who have seen Bharat  seriously think @BeingSalmanKhan should get the National award @aliabbaszafar
#DurgeshgorerGuptodhon a shining example of a resurgent Bengali cinema.Bright charming and eager. @itsmeabir's scholarly sleuth is smooth.'3 stars.
No greater disservice to the victorious prime minister Modiji than the film by Omung https://t.co/gB2IiQKs1Y is an insult to the illustrious leader and an embarrassment to PM Modi  at a time when the nation celebrates his return to power
'#RajkumarGupta's #IndiasMostWanted's  is a thriller like no other. It grips us by our throat ,and demolishes our nurtured notions of cinema on terrorism. @arjunk26  plays the truest hero of our troubled times.A gamechanger for him,and for us too.' 4 stars.
#MrLocal is the most disgusting misogynistic film I have seen in recent years.If Tamil cinema wants to grow then such trashy films must be banned
Dear #HinaKhan as an outsider who has struggled all his career against slammed doors all I will say is...go for it, girl. The universe is your playground
#DeDePyaarDe ..this summer the coolest one..smart ,sassy and supremely sexy this romcom is a riot with @ajaydevgn and Tabu in full form.'4 and a half stars. #luvranjan
#DeDePyarDe  I suspect is much more than a naughty romcom on adultery.@ajaydevgn and Tabu are actors who never fail to surprise you.And #LuvRanjan is a master at manoeuvring emotions at the edge of hilarity. can't wait
The one good that comes out of #StudentOfTheYear2.Kalank would no longer be seen as the worst Dharma production
Tamil cinema has a new no. 1 superstar. @VishalKOfficial . See #Ayogya and you'll know what I mean
Apart from the fresh exuberant cast #StudentoftheYear2 has nothing interesting to https://t.co/FrFBKHGD3n is duh cinema which no amount of splashy colour can save from being a washout.2 stars
#StudentOfTheYear2  is Jeeta Wohi Sikandar 2 .Does it live up to expectations? What expectations?????!!!! The only surprise is Will Smith's sudden appearance.
#Maharishi..stupendous..entertaining..relevant.. @urstrulyMahesh is a force to reckon with..4 stars
Out of work actors from outside Bollywood taking potshots at @akshaykumar's nationality issue.Arrey Sharm karo.Akshay has done more nationalistic films than any contemporary actor.not one other  A-lister from our cinema has displayed Akshay's level of social conscientiousness
' #Setters is an engrossing expose on the murky world of  doppelganger examinees.taut and revealing. ' 3 and a half stars.
nowadays everyone is a potential film critic no qualification just the ability to be as nasty .the so-called reviews don't tell us why we should or shouldn't see a film only that the actor is someone's nephew &amp; the actress looks nice after https://t.co/MEF40X1Ss1 cute &amp;irrelevant
#AshwiniChaudhary's Setters opening on Friday takes a piercing look at the cult of doppelganger examinees . Should be very interesting @AftabShivdasani
There is something impressively different about #karankapadia  who makes his debut in #Blank this week.the most talented make debutant I've seen since #ranbirkapoor
'#Blank is a terrific cat and mouse thriller with @iamsunnydeol at top of the game.Karan Kapadia makes an explosive debut. Not to be missed.' 4 stars.
Why does @akshaykumar's interview with Modiji come across as so genuine? Because success has not changed Akshay at all. I've seen overambitious actors turn into overnight monsters, Akshay has remained the same humble affable caring frnd for 20 years.more power to the real heroes.
The #AliAli music video featuring debutant Karan Kapadia with @akshaykumar is indicative of Karan's confident debut this coming Friday in the film #Blank
One sun one moon one #LataMangeshkar
The best song @BeingSalmanKhan has ever sung on screen Ek Ajnabee sa ehsaas dil ko sataaye in Lucky.The song sung to soaring heights of romanticism by @AdnanSamiLive and the Goddess @mangeshkarlata ji is an epic
.@BeingSalmanKhan&amp;  @aliabbaszafar in #Bharat  prove they're are among the most  potent directorial duos  of  contemporary https://t.co/oV8KkvPqW8 what #AmitabhBachchan &amp; Manmohan Desai use to be. We can't miss the special spark  in  trailer. This  film smells like a  blockbuster
The trailer of @VishalKOfficial's #Ayogya  sees him play the cocky cop from Temper and Simmba with just that extra bit of swag. Blockbuster. Will Vishal do better than Ranveer in Simmba and NTR jr in Temper?
Sure I may slip up in my review of a Telugu Malayalam or Bangla film because of my inadequate knowledge of the language.but hey I am learning and I won't stop Jai hind
I love movies in every Indian language .to me #VijayDeverakonda is as big a star as Varun Dhawan and Rajinikanth is as iconic as Amitabh Bachchan. to question my right to review a film in Telugu or Tamil just because I am North Indian is according to me sickeningly parochial.
#Jersey is a treat for #Nani fans. it has its heart in the right place and it knows how to make the audience melt in submission. 3 stars
Missed @SrideviBKapoor all through #Kalank. Why did she have to go?
'#Kalank is gorgeous both inside and outside.The epic love story glides gracefully through glorious chapters  unravelling pain and passion.  A majestic achievement with stellar performances to be experienced only on the big screen.'4 stars @aliaa08 @Varun_dvn @MadhuriDixit
@akshaya_bhatt @aliaa08 @MadhuriDixit @karanjohar I  miss  those  days  too. Thank  you for reminding me  of  them
Getting restless to see what magic  all these A Listers from A (@aliaa08) to M(@MadhuriDixit) have created in #Kalank. do you feel it will be the biggest hit of 2019? @karanjohar
#SrijitMukherjee's #Vincida is arguably the finest psychological thriller India has ever produced and the two central performances define excellence. already my favourite film of the year. 4 and a half stars
After sitting through 10 episodes of the riveting webseries #CriminalJustice I am certain @TripathiiPankaj is at the moment the most engaging actor in Hindi https://t.co/MXQPvMn6Y7 you agree? @nairsameer
.@urstrulyMahesh is back with a film that has blockbuster written on it. the teaser of #Maharshi is stylish and provocative.  sureshot, watch here:https://t.co/hLvJgrdPNY
In #Majili @chay_akkineni  finally comes into his own. As a loser who won't give up Naga delivers a performance as sensitive and subtle as @Samanthaprabhu2. #Majili is a tender passionate warm and effective ode to love. 3 and a half stars.
'#RAW ..relevant,visceral.gripping..it is a step-up for the espionage genre with John in full form'. 4 stars. @TheJohnAbraham
'#NoFathersInKashmir must be seen by every Indian. It tells us things we don't want to hear...Tucked away in this despairing cry of muffled anguish is a tender love story which is hard to leave behind.'4 stars.
The trailer of #DeDePyaarDe  sparkles with tongue-in-cheek humour. Wonder what #SaifAliKhan and #KareenaKapoorKhan have to say about it. @ajaydevgn #luvranjan
#GoneKesh have you heard of it? No great shakes.But a reasonably competent motivational drama released this week was killed by inept marketing and release. Sometimes it feels as though producers want their films to go unnoticed
After Parmanu @TheJohnAbraham  in another spy thriller can't wait to see Robby Grewal's #RAW. I get the feeling this will be yet another hit  in this year of torrential success @viacom
Best films of the first quarter of the  year  #Kesari and #SuperDelux(Tamil) and your pick?
#GrahamSteines lives again!The Least Of These..a powerful piece of cinematic documentation on an incident that shook the nation's conscience..relevant and disturbing. 4 stars.
Thanks to director #ChuckRussell he told us #VidyutJamwal is comparable with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dwayne Johnson.we Indians are so myopic we would have never known
#Junglee is the most (unintentionally) comical fill I have seen in recent times far funnier than #TotalDhamaal
'A beautiful love story..#notebook, a  fragile lyrical ode to love that is bound to bring a smile to your face' 4 stars.Kaun aisi film banata hai ?hats off to Salman Khan for backing this ode to love @BeingSalmanKhan
No marriage on April 19 of @arjunk26  and #MalaikaArora.Arjun's father @SrideviBKapoor says it's manufactured news
#Notebook seems to have 5 protagonists  ...the 2  very promising newcomers @PranutanBahl and @iamzahero  , director Nitin Kakkar, the state of Jammu and Kashmir and above all @BeingSalmanKhan who has backed this refreshing project
This is why we take #Rajesh for granted he plays every character as though he owns them from way back before the camera started.take a bow Mr Tailang you are that rare actor who doesn't act.
Reviewing Netflix's  #DelhiCrime I did the unpardonable.I forgot to mention #RajeshTailang who plays a dedicated cop   with a brilliance that makes it look effortless. https://t.co/E8ntqZvKGW
The First Class song in #Kalank is such a clunky kalank. Who danced like that in preIndependence India ? And what's with that Kajal in #VarunDhawan's eyes? must a community be stereotyped even by so-called cosmopolitan filmmakers ?
#Kesari serves up a lesson for Bollywood.stop making  biopics on terrorists, gangsters, serial killers,TADA accused actors and other scumbags.there are enough unsung heroes in our history to fill up move theatres for the next 10 years
#Kesari is a tribute to the Sikhs,one of the bravest communities of India.every perpetrater of the 1984 riots must be made to watch this neo-classic. @akshaykumar
Haunted by the sheer grit and glory of #Kesari..not only the 21 who fought that war but also the team that has dared make a film on the unsung heroes @akshaykumar
With #Kesari @akshaykumar again proves himself the finest star actor we have.who can stop him from winning the National award for playing this valorous soldier so vigorously?
'#Kesari the best war film India has produced.'5 stars. @akshaykumar @ParineetiChopra
#MardKoDardNahinHota is quirky and funny unlike anything we've seen https://t.co/vnxAKmknxr playfully twists the conventions of machismo and watches the fun unfold.,'3 and a half stars.
I just saw @aliaa08 dancing in #Kalank. Dear @karanjohar,thank you for giving cinema this amazing precious gift.Alia is the best thing to happen to our cinema since Sridevi
A portal  screams  a headline  declaring a ‘jugalbandi’ between #MadhuriDixit  and #AliaBhatt  in #Kalank. However speaking to me Alia very clearly states she has no dance item with  Madhuri . “I dance  in the  film but not with Madhuri M’aam. Am I  mad to dance with her?”
Some  desperate  portals are practising porn policing. They pretend to be shocked and angered  by trolls attacking stars  and their personal  relationships and then try to get eyeballs by  publishing those trolls. The best way to deal with ugliness is to ignore it.
#RiteshBatra's #Photograph is such a letdown . from Robert Redford and Jane Fonda to @Nawazuddin_S and #SanyaMalhotra what a climbdown for the Lunchbox director
What a week this is at the movies  3 sparkling gems... #Hamid, #MerePyarePrimeMinister  and #MilanTalkies . This looks like another spectacular year for Hindi cinema @RakeyshOmMehra
#MilanTalkies is one of the most entertaining love stories I've seen in recent https://t.co/Yj5S3XiQeo has the potential to be a sure hit.but audience aye to sahi
'#MilanTalkies .. For all those who love the magic of movies @tigmanshudhulia's wicked warm and funny homage to the enduring magic of the motion picture.the director's gentlest most benign film to date.'4 stars.
No #ManojBajpai in #GuliGuleiyan or Missing. No @diljitdosanjh in #Soorma. this is the same awards which honoured Shankar Jaikishan for their music in Beimaan during the same year as Ghulam Mohamed in Pakeezaah
'Magical! #MerePyarePrimeMinister is all heart..hearwarming and heartbreaking it says so much about the have-nots with so little fuss and so much economy and grace.this is @RakeyshOmMehra's best work since Rang De Basanti.'4 stars.
#RiteshBatra's  #Photograph  looks  like the  Rajshri-produced Lekh Tandon directed rom-com #DulhanWohiJoPiyaMaanBhaye re-mixed. Uncanny coincidence?  Or just a scarcity  of  really  original  ideas?
Why do our stars talk about the films that they have rejected ? It is in such bad taste .Have you ever heard of any Hollywood actors bragging about the roles they didn't do?
#Badla Movie Review: It Is A Nifty Nugget Of A Noire! @SrBachchan @taapsee @sujoy_g Rating: 4 Stars

Team of @SameerDixxit @jatishvarma @girishjohar @kewalgarg to make a film on an Indian girl rescued from Pakistan. Written by @writish ,it's lead character is based on J P Singh, former Indian Deputy High Commissioner in Islamabad who made this possible in 2017 https://t.co/45YmzxJdmR
Rishi Kapoor to return to India at March end after medical treatment in the US.this is complete hogwash invented by hit-hungry portals.I connected with him and he categorically told me he is not returning at the end of month. Do show sensitivity on health issues @chintskap
It is sickening to know filmmakers are already announcing   projects on #PulwamaAttack  #BalakotAirStrike and the surgical strike . The wounds are raw the blood has not dried and the vultures get into the exploitative mode. kuch toh sharm karo
with #LukaChuppi @TheAaryanKartik and producer #DineshVijan are all set to encore their previous blockbuster .... Kartik's Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety and Vijay's Stree. Round of applause for both
#LukaChuppi is loads of fun.who says intelligent comedies don't work?this is totally empowered progressive dhamaal.'4 stars. @kritisanon
2019  is another  spectacular  year  for  our  movies. The  year  is only two months  old and we already have three remarkable  films #Uri, #GullyBoy  and  now  #Sonechiriya
'Raw  gritty and compelling, #Sonechiriya conveys a clandestine narrative stylishness  that never impinges on the violent disarray of the characters' brutal unpredictable lives.'5  stars. @itsSSR @bhumipednekar @BajpayeeManoj
Everywhere we are reading  that  #SalmanKhan and Bhansali are  coming together after 19 years.What about  Saawariya  in  2007?  Convenient amnesia?
Remembering  the  one and  only #Sridevi. There will never be another  like you.
'With the second part of his NTR biopic director #Krish again proves himself a master storyteller.He does full justice to the great #NTR saga.this is one of the most engaging biopics in recent times.'4 stars.
#IndraKumar is that prankster in Class 5 who never grew up.A shame to see actors like Madhuri, Anil , Devgan and Warsi associated with such juvenile trash.We get better jokes as WhatsApp forwards
#TotalDhamaal is the armpit of lowbrow entertainment.Not one single gag is amusing .It is dismaying that such garbage is considered entertainment by some filmmaker.@AnilKapoor @ArshadWarsi @ajaydevgn
The trailer of #Kesari is so passionate and powerful and no Bollywood actor can carry the Sikh turban like @akshaykumar
After #GullyBoy and #ZoyaAkhtar  filmmaking in Hindi is freed of gender specificity .we no longer need  to refer to a film by a woman director as such @RanveerOfficial
#NagarKirtan is not only a pathbreaking masterpiece on gender conflict it gives us one of India's finest actors https://t.co/B86xioZx7G 20, #RidhiSen as the gender-challenged #Parimal is a textbook of brilliant acting.'5 stars.
Have you seen the trailer of #NTR  @mahanayakudu ? The sequel to  NTR #Kathanayukdu looks even more spectacular and emotional.#krish the real director of #Manikarnika is a master storyteller and I can't wait to see the second part of the NTR saga this Friday
Watched the Japanese  masterpiece Shoplifters the most moving meditation on poverty  I've seen since #SatyajitRay's #PatherPanchali. It would be  a crime against  humanity  to  give the Oscar  for best foreign  film to #Roma instead  of Shoplifters.
#GullyBoy  a fluent virile robust masterpiece about wacked dreams..@RanveerOfficial and @aliaa08 are a fused force of Nature.this is @zoyaakhtar's best.'5 stars. Subhash K Jha
Felt a tingle in my heart watching the trailer of #MerePyarePMPyare .this is a big hearted film that every Indian should see before it's to late.thanks, @RakeyshOmMehra, for this ruminative rang this basant.
Saw the new much talked-about Malayalam film #9. So so  bloody disappointing. The chills are  more  pretentious than portentous. #PrithviRaj came on  the scene with such promise. Now he's just    hustling his concept  of  polished  entertainment. Sorry, doesnt work
Happy Birthday to my dear friend @juniorbachchan . I  ve never felt I am with a star in your company and that's the best compliment I can think of for your pure heart
The latest victim of vandalism is the #RajeshRoshan composed Mungda . have you seen what they've done to it in Total Dhamaal? everyone associated with this act of desecration should be ashamed of themselves. do you think it is fair ?
#EkLadkiKoDekhaTohAisaLaga banned in the Gulf . now my brother in Singapore tells me he can't take his daughter to the film because it is rated  R21 down there . Really??? Time for these closed societies to wake up @sonamakapoor @RajkummarRao

#Sridevi 's memory being desecrated by vandals posing as filmmakers in a sleazy film entitled Sridevi Bungalow.Shame on everyone involved with this perverse project .Show some sensitivity, for God's sake.if not for Sridevi's fans then for her still- grieving family.
A sincere plea to B R Chopra's grandsons. Pls stop remaking your Dadaji's films . it is lazy and convenient but also unethical look what you did to Ittefaq . What the...! now you are remaking #PatiPatniAurWoh? Seriously? Aapko  thande thande paani mein nahana chahiye
Just finished watching #Petta.hugely enjoyable unpretentious masala fare.the best @rajinikanth starrer in years.
#AccidentalPrimeMinister  is anchored by rock- solid performances by @AnupamPKher and #AkshayeKhanna. I can't imagine a better tribute to Mr Mamohan Singh's imperturbable personality . Well intended and filled with durbari intrigue @ashokepandit

The biopic this week that I am most excited about is NTR superstar son #Balakrishna playing his father this has  to be special. All the other Pongal  releases  seem pale in  comparison
Three  prominent  real-life  political dramas in theatres this Friday.The #AccidentalPrimeMinister on Manmohan Singh, #Uri  on  the 2016 surgical strike against Pakistan,  and  NTR (Telugu)  the bio-pic on N T Rama Rao. Which one  are  you most excited about?

#RanveerSingh as  @SimmbaTheFilm puts in as much energy and aggression on screen as he did as Allauddin Khilji in Padmaavat .this man is unstoppable
The immortal  #Sridevi must be  smiling from heaven. First daughter Janhvi  and her  well-received  debut in Dhadak. Now Khushi is all set to  be seen  in 2019 opposite #SaifAliKhan's son Ebrahim. The Gods have  splendid plans  for  your  daughters, Srideviji. RIP
Breaking News: Will #Simmba hit theatres  on Thursday  instead  of  Friday? Efforts are  on to prepone the  release  of @RanveerOfficial 's year-end dhamaka by  a  day. So  would you like to  see it a day in advance?
I stand corrected #SRK and #SalmanKhan did dance together in Karan Arjun. but damn their trippy togetherness in the Issaqbaazi number in #Zero is something else. Mazaa hi kuch aur hai, hai na?
SRK and @BeingSalmanKhan dancing together in #Zero has never happened in any film before, though they were together in Karan Arjun and Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam. what a delightful treat . The two superstars may be together again soon in a Sajid Nadiadwala film @iamsrk @Zero21Dec
#Zero is @iamsrk 's career's best performance but the real surprise is Katrina Kaif . she is simply , or not so simply , STUNNING . take a bow, Lady
What a complete fiim about incomplete lives #Zero is! End the year with a film that builds a permanent place in your heart.wah Bauaa ji wah.'4 and a half stars. ,@iamsrk @AnushkaSharma @aanandlrai
By the  time 2019 ends there will be only  one major unmarried star. @BeingSalmanKhan
Would #Zero join Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and Swades to become the 3 most iconic films of @iamsrk's career? Director @aanandlrai and writer #HimanshuSharma have created magic together in  the past. This time they will outdo each  other. Pukka.
Four more days for #Zero to zoom into theatres. How excited  are you  to watch @iamsrk like never before? It's  a decisive  moment
2nd season of #ItsNotThatSimple is a well-constructed bric-a-brac with credible performances by @ReallySwara &amp; @Purab_Kohli &amp; dialogues aspire to reflect the thoughts of the millenial partnerships.But who calls a woman a 'c..ctease' in today's day&amp;age?I could see Swara cringe.
I haven't seen Zero as yet . @iamsrk could beat Varun. Critics' choice best actor @diljitdosanjh in Soorma best actress #RaniMukherjee in #Hichki best film #Tumbbad
My choices for the popular awards 2018 are: best actor @Varun_dvn  in October . Best actress @aliaa08 in #Raazi . Best   film #BadhaiHo. Best director #sriramraghavan in #AndhaDhun. Best male and female debutant @imIshaanKhatter and #SaraAliKhan
why do I get  the feeling that #Zero will be the  best film of  the year?So far my favourite  film of 2018 are #October and #BadhaiHo. What about  you? @iamsrk @aanandlrai @Varun_dvn @ShoojitSircar
Don't waste  your time on  #Aquaman this  week. Watch  Julia Roberts in the powerful  mother-son reunion dramna Ben Is Back or the delightfully irreverent  Spiderman Into Spiderverse
Imperialistic hypocrisy : We condemn  #ThugsOfHindustan  for  its over-the-top costumed  fantasy. But we find the same  quality in #Aquaman to be  sassy. cute, dazzling, etc etc.
#AnushkaSharma is not starring with Salman Khan in Sanjay Bhansali's next. That's news??? Here's the  news: Salman is  not starring in Bhansali's  next
It was  a race to  the finishing line for  the #DeepikaRanveer and  #PiyankaNick marriages  in 2018. In 2019 who will marry  first, @arjunk26 and #MalaikaArora  or  @Varun_dvn and his  girlfriend Natasha?
#Kedarnath is everything that a bonafide love story should be,then some more..lyrical,moving,tender  evocative and provocative...director @Abhishekapoor has created a romance of epic proportions.Sara Ali Khan is the discovery of the year.The climax is stunning.' 4.5 stars @itsSSR
#NextEnti (telugu)..frothy bubbly effervescent yet relevant..beautifully shot..better than #kunalkohli 's original Hum Tum' 3 and a half stars
Incidentally #Saif’s Baazaar is the  first  film with that title to be  a hit. In  1982 Sagar Sarhadi’s #Bazaar was  a highly acclaimed  film which  didn’t  make  money. Earlier there were  films like Bazaar (1949) Meena  Bazar(1950) and Bazaar Band Karo (1974) which flopped.
Tweet 1: The  good times are rolling out for #SaifAliKhan. While son #Taimur is hellbent on  being  the  youngest rock star Saif has also had a satisfying year with the  success of  his  #SacredGames . Saif’s  feature-film  appearance in 2018 in Baazaar also paid rich dividends.
Some website called The  Cut does a botched up silly hatchet job on @priyankachopra , calling her, among other things,a  gold digger a schemer who trapped Nick Jonas. Why are we even talking about  this crappy malicious vitriolic vomit of an article?
#PriyankaChopra gives wedding picture exclusively to an American magazine. #KatrinaKaif  speaks about  her 'blessed' breakup with Ranbir  to Vogue . Gosh,  Indian media is just not  worthy of our desi divas
#Kedarnath with its confluence of passion and cataclysm looks like the kind of love story that dares to be genre-defining .I  can't wait to see what director Abhishek Kapoor has done with @itsSSR and #Sarakhan .are you looking forward to it?
#2Point0 has apparently collected Rs 75 crores on the first day in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.Does it really matter  if  the plot makes no sense? Who goes  to  a #Rajinikanth starrer expecting common sense?
After watching #2Point0 I suddenly feel kinder  towards #ThugsOfHindostan. 1 star  for 2: 0
#2Point0 is staggeringly mediocre. So much talent and resource gone into making a film that will probably sink as low as  #ThugsofHindostan
Beautiful ! @diljitdosanjh  new song  #JindMahi with the lovely @BanitaSandhu in  the  video, is so tender and supple, I can't stop humming it. Beautiful way to end a fruitful year for Diljit. BTW, why is Banita not  doing more films after October?
Hours to go before  the  Big Bang in the theatres...While the  advance booking for #2point0 is impressive, do you think  it will be able to sustain itself at the  boxoffice? @akshaykumar
The #censorboard become the censor BORED no accountability no accessibility who is running the place?
RIP #MohdAziz, your voice ruled in the 1980s. What range, what throw in your voice...wah! Patjhad sawan  basant bahaar ek baras ke mausam chaar...
Like @RanveerOfficial at his wedding @priyankachopra will  dance  her heart out at her wedding.She  is  the most excited  bride  you will ever see at her own wedding.
