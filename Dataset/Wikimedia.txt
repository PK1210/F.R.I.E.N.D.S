The hard work is just beginning, but by meaningfully engaging more people and organizations today and in the future, we can develop standards and principles that are more inclusive, more enforceable, and more effective. We are encouraged by the possibility in front of us.
This week's @IJurisdiction conference produced some powerful momentum and collaboration between a multitude of stakeholders towards this shared future.

We hope that the European Court of Human Rights shares our commitment to knowledge as a human right and will order Turkey to lift the block.
Wikipedia is better, richer, and more reflective of the world when more people can engage with its content. This is why we're asking Turkey to end censorship and #UnblockWikipedia.
Throughout these efforts, we stayed true to our values and stance against censorship. Wikipedia is one of the largest, most widely-accessed sources of knowledge in the world, read 6,000 times per second with over 250,000 volunteer contributors worldwide.
This is not a step we have taken lightly; @Wikimedia Foundation made every attempt to pursue action in the Turkish courts, to understand any concerns from the Turkish authorities, and raise awareness of the block and its impact.
Over the past two years, governments have blocked and censored Wikipedia in Turkey and now in China, barring millions of citizens from accessing and contributing to the world‚Äôs largest source of free, collaborative knowledge. This filing seeks to rectify that. #UnblockWikipedia
We believe knowledge is a fundamental human right, which is why we're taking our case to lift the block of Wikipedia in Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights. https://t.co/1wK17iMkbD #UnblockWikipedia https://t.co/sEWiNeTy2W

We believe that the best encyclopedia is one where all the volunteers can collaborate together, understand what work has been done on an article already, and improve the quality of each article over time.
Looking at the wider picture, it is our firm belief that most complaints are better resolved when the subject of an article works with @Wikipedia's volunteer editor community to improve it rather than bringing legal action.
This legal decision is disappointing for us, but it is not a notable change in the law and does not impose any new editorial standards on individual @Wikipedia contributors.
