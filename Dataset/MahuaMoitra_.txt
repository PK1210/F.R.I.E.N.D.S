By the way, public companies making such huge donations to political parties means lesser dividend to its shareholders.

Wow. @BJP4India got 600 crore from Bharti and DLF.

Still both companies are struggling to survive.

Airtel being beaten black and blue by Reliance Jio.

DLF being hounded by CCI &amp; the govt. for its past deals with Robert Vadra.

Truth is, our current lot of leaders downplay their mistakes and losses. They try to appropriate whatever achievement by whoever and they amplify it with their bought media and journalists to create a state of happy delirium. So none asks uncomfortable questions.
