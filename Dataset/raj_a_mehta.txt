@azeem2112 Wah kya baat kahi!
The Manmarziyan controversy is beyond baffling. Is there a way to reverse the direction we‚Äôre heading in, or at least apply the brakes?
Worst yet, we may even have largely accepted it. It may seem like dictatorship in the short-term, but it‚Äôs actually spoon-feeding the society in general for the long term, which I am fairly sure is harmful, its effects far-reaching, way beyond just cinema.
Because we‚Äôve become so used to being clearly and explicitly told how far can our cinema go in portraying the reality of our society or the characters that inhabit it, I think we‚Äôve lost sight of the fact that this is extremely, extremely dangerous and unfair.
Thanks @KanikaDhillon and @anuragkashyap72 for introducing us to another way small-town love stories can be told. Dynamic, gritty and above all, real. Congrats to the entire team! #Manmarziyaan
