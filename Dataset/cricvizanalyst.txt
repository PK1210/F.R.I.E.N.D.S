According to our Expected Runs Model the last ball of the match in the final - the full toss from Boult that Stokes bunted for one - was the second worst ball of the match with an xR of 1.68. In almost every other situation you’d expect Stokes to look for the boundary. #CWC19

Since the last World Cup, England have failed to chase 242 or less on two occasions, in the 21 times it's been set. #CWC19
In this World Cup Mark Wood has brought a unique approach to death bowling. More than half his deliveries have been short (59%) and from those deliveries he has only conceded runs at 4.88 runs per over. No other death bowler has bowled more than half their balls short. #CWC19

New Zealand have a 14% chance of victory according to WinViz. Can they claw their way back into this contest? #CWC19
Jofra Archer has hit the batsman on the helmet three times in this World Cup - no bowler has done so more frequently. #CWC19
Liam Plunkett has never bowled his full complement of overs, taken three wickets, and had a better economy than he has done today. #CWC19
Jonny Bairstow is a fantastic out-fielder considering that he spends most of his time keeping wicket. This @CricViz graphics suggests he's saved 24 runs in this tournament in the field - matched with his batting efforts, he's had a hell of a competition. #CWC19 https://t.co/0e8USyNROo
New Zealand have scored at 7.3rpo at the death in this World Cup - that's the sixth fastest of the ten teams involved. #CWC19
PredictViz, staying calm in the midst of a dramatic day, is forecasting that New Zealand are going to post 256 - in the circumstances, that would be a competitive total. #CWC19
As well as his performances with the ball, Chris Woakes has been excellent in the field this World Cup. @CricViz fielding measurements suggests that he's saved 22 runs with his fielding across the tournament. #CWC19 https://t.co/mfMTqzFyUZ

England love to bowl short in the middle overs, using sweepers on either boundary while Plunkett and Stokes hammer away. However, it's a dangerous tactic against Taylor - he averages 87 against the short ball. #CWC19
PitchViz gives this surface a 6.3/10 rating. That makes it the equal eighth toughest pitch for batting in this tournament. 260/270 could be a very competitive score in this match. #CWC19
Combining his head-to-head figures, Ross Taylor averages 119.80 against this England attack. #CWC19
Only once in his career has Liam Plunkett taken two wickets in a spell with better economy than the 1.75rpo he's managed today. #CWC19
Ross Taylor will fancy a bit of Adil Rashid, as he does all spinners. Since the Champions Trophy, he averages 96.62 against spin; only Kohli, Rohit and Hope average more in that time (min 20 innings). #CWC19
Seamers in the last decade to take more middle overs wickets than Liam Plunkett, at a better strike rate:

- Mitchell Starc
- Dale Steyn
- Morne Morkel
- Mitchell Johnson

#CWC19
Liam Plunkett has a superb ODI record at Lord's - perhaps surprising given the short square boundaries. He now has 14 wickets at an average of 18.28 and a True Economy Rate of -0.69 runs per over at the venue. #CWC19
@AntiFTBL Thanks ever so much!
Excellent knock from Henry Nicholls. He's had a strange tournament; Munro, ousted, averaged 25 whilst Nicholls, with the narrative around him so positive, has averaged 29. He's scored slower than Munro, and played more false shots. #CWC19
No England bowler in this match has dismissed Ross Taylor more than once in ODIs. #CWC19
Plunkett’s ball to dismiss Williamson pitched 5.75 metres from the stumps and therefore in the full length range. #CWC19 https://t.co/f6EkGonVIq
Liam Plunkett has developed a deserved reputation for slower balls, cross seam that behave differently to seam up balls. The 128kph ball that removed Williamson - the key opposition wicket in a World Cup final - was the slowest he'd bowled to Kane today. #CWC19
The wicket of Kane Williamson has seen New Zealand's WinViz fall from 32% to 24%. #CWC19
In 2019, Kane Williamson averages 37.00 when New Zealand lose, but 82.37 when New Zealand win. #CWC19
Rashid should attack Williamson with his googly. Across his ODI career Williamson averages 47.15 against leg breaks but 22.00 against googlies. #CWC19
Brilliant from New Zealand so far, who have stayed calm amidst some difficult conditions - but they're still living dangerously. In the first 10 overs, they played 24% false shots - since then, that's risen to 29%. #CWC19
After facing 45 balls Williamson is significantly more vulnerable against full lengths than good and short lengths. He is dismissed every 27 full balls after this phase of his innings. #CWC19 https://t.co/OiIC7FQpKZ

At the start of play, England's WinViz stood at 68%; it now stands at 72%. The wicket of Martin Guptill was crucial, and has settled some England nerves, but it has only increased their chance of victory only marginally. #CWC19
Henry Nicholls has started slowly, but he does have the strength to catch up. He's not the most explosive, but when he's faced 60+ balls he does score at over 7rpo. England will not mind him being subdued, but they'll still be twitchy. #CWC19 https://t.co/pj1FAD9bhi
Today was Chris Woakes' longest ever opening spell in an ODI. #CWC19
England are bowling exceptionally well to Williamson. They are hammering away on a good length and he’s been unable to get going so far. #CWC19 https://t.co/P0rPPSccFT
Henry Nicholls played eight attacking shots in the first 10 overs, but he's played seven in the last two overs. A concerted effort from the Black Caps opener to up his scoring rate. #CWC19
England might be keeping Woakes on for longer because, whereas they might normally bring Rashid in for an early dart, he's been smashed by Kane Williamson. The NZ skipper has hit 164 runs from 130 balls against England's spinner - with only one wicket. #CWC19
Chris Woakes' opening spell has been immaculate, but also very attacking. He's pitched up with 23% of his deliveries, compared to Archer's 7% - he's doing the job of targeting the batsman's pads, as shown by the Guptill dismissal. #CWC19 https://t.co/njfOFSEWgV
Archer isn't pitching up, playing a more intimidatory role. Just 10% of his deliveries so far have been pitched full (6m from the batsman's stumps or closer). That's the lowest figure he's ever recorded in an opening spell. #CWC19
The margin for error when bowling to Williamson is tiny. England need to look to hit a good length and keep the ball in the channel outside off stump. This dismissal beehive illustrates how he struggles against balls in this zone. #CWC19 https://t.co/VjzPBZp8WH
Chris Woakes' delivery to dismiss Guptill was the fullest ball the Englishman has bowled all morning. #CWC19 https://t.co/409NiFb1V0
Henry Nicholls averages 15.16 against 140kph bowling. Big spell from Archer coming up. #CWC19
England need to gauge the bounce quickly. Only one of their deliveries so far have been fuller than the Nicholls LBW review - if that's going over, then very little else is going to hit unless you pitch it up. #CWC19

One remarkable thing about Jofra Archer's dismissal of Finch in the semi-final is the Archer doesn't tend to attack the stumps first up. He is relentlessly back of a length in the channel, with a few variations mixed in. With his pace, it's a top strategy. #CWC19 https://t.co/zoGzOwtNRL
Martin Guptill is such an important player to New Zealand. Even though he's been out of form, he's still the most likely player to take the game away from England. He absolutely obliterates width - Archer and Woakes need to keep their lines tight. #CWC19 https://t.co/WJWI72Ggww

CricViz's Expected Wicket model suggests that Roy has scored 29 more runs against the deliveries he's faced than we would expect. He has dominated Australia with aggression and execution. #CWC19
Cracking ball from Mitchell Starc to remove the set Bairstow. Full, swinging in at 142kph - it was a jaffa. Our Expected Wicket model says it would take a wicket 4.5% of the time, making it the second most dangerous ball that Starc has bowled today. #CWC19
Only one other English batsman has hit three consecutive sixes against Australia - Moeen Ali, ahead of the last World Cup, in Hobart. #CWC19

The second highest averaging ODI opening pair of all time (min 30 innings) is Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes, who averaged 52.55. 

The best opening pair, Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy, average 70.00.

#CWC19
Jason Roy has attacked 49.7% of the deliveries he's faced in this World Cup. Only two openers have exceeded that - nobody has matched it with any degree of success. #CWC19 https://t.co/ritqZIj9Fg
Australia have been slightly faster than England were in the first 10 overs, and have found slightly more swing - 0.7° compared to 0.6. They've both bowled 35% short balls, and roughly 50% of balls in the channel. #CWC19
Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow have made 455 runs together in this World Cup. Only 16 other pairs in history have made more in a World Cup, and only one - Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan in 2015 - have done so at a higher scoring rate. #CWC19
Jason Roy has hit some lovely shots through the offside so far, but as this graphic shows, he is just as effective through midwicket. You can't drift too wide, but he'll punish you if you get too straight. #CWC19 https://t.co/e6OpXIBGK1
Length is key when bowling to Jason Roy. He hits full balls at 7.5rpo, he hits short balls at 7.5rpo, but he hits good length balls at 4.2rpo and averages just 33. #CWC19
Left-handed bowlers are like kryptonite for England's openers. Bairstow averages 47 against ra pace, and 31 against la pace; for Roy, it's 50 and 30. Starc and Behrendorff are the nightmare opening pair for these two. #CWC19

No England bowler has ever taken more wickets in a World Cup than Jofra Archer has in 2019. A remarkable debut summer for the young man. #CWC19
The PitchViz Pace Rating for this surface so far is 6.5/10, the higher the number the quicker the surface. 18 pitches have been quicker in this tournament, but this is not a sticky pitch - Archer's knuckle ball wicket was skill, not conditions. #CWC19
The bouncer barrage from Archer, followed up with the 121kph knuckle ball, was perfect. The short balls sent Maxwell deep in his crease, before the second fullest and slowest ball he bowled ruined Maxwell's timing. He lunged at the ball - and chipped it to cover. #CWC19 https://t.co/yG1De1fJyn
England need to bounce Maxwell out, and Maxwell needs to counter that tactic. He has averaged just 17.16 against the short ball in 2019 - Jofra Archer will feel he has to target that weakness. #CWC19
Steve Smith has respected the good length delivery today. He's scored just nine deliveries against the 25 good length balls he's faced. However, he's looked to punish England when they've missed their length, scoring at 7.4rpo against full balls. Clinical batting. #CWC19
Adil Rashid has recovered well. His first four overs went for 29 runs, but his last two have gone for five. He looks in much better rhythm. #CWC19
In ODI knockout cricket, Steve Smith averages 76.20, compared to 41.58 in all other matches. #CWC19
The ball from Adil Rashid to dismiss Alex Carey spun 4.4° - the most of any ball today. #CWC19
That's the fifth time Adil Rashid has removed Marcus Stoinis in ODI cricket, from 95 balls, at an average of 20. #CWC19
Economy Rate for Seamers today:

Full balls - 8.4rpo

Good Length balls - 1.8rpo

Short balls - 3.4rpo

#CWC19
Adil Rashid is firing it through. He's bowling at an average of 82.9kph, the fastest he's bowled in any ODI this home summer. #CWC19
The PitchViz Rating for this surface is 5.0/10. That makes it the 11th best surface for batting we've seen in this competition. Semi final chases are always going to be tough, but this pitch is not as difficult as others we've seen. #CWC19
England have been a little lacklustre in the last 10 overs, but Australia are only slowly working their way back into this. When Alex Carey and Steve Smith came together, their WinViz was at 14%. It's now risen, but only to 23%. #CWC19
Australia have significantly settled down. In the first ten overs, they played 35% false shots; since then, that has fallen to 13%. #CWC19
Steve Smith is hanging on. He's looked scrappy, but he's trying to keep a positive mindset - whenever England have given him proper width, or have gone too full, he's attacked. #CWC19 https://t.co/3KihOFdPbz
What an opening spell from Jofra Archer. As well as the wicket, he found the edge or beat the bat on nine occasions. He bowled with venom, back of a length - the wicket ball was one of only two deliveries that would have hit the stumps. This was elite aggressive bowling. #CWC19 https://t.co/vUeqKMJVb1
Our Wicket Probability model suggests that England actually bowled better against Australia in the group. On that occasion, their xW in the opening 10 overs was 1.49; today, it was 1.28. Sometimes, you get the luck, but England will not mind one bit that it's come now. #CWC19
Archer and Woakes have been so accurate today. 52% of their deliveries have been on a good line and length - the last time they bettered that at the start of an innings was June 2018. #CWC19
The ball that knocked Alex Carey's helmet off was the fourth slowest ball Jofra Archer has bowled today. #CWC19
Peter Handscomb is not strong against pitched up bowling on his stumps - and England have worked it out. #CWC19 https://t.co/52Lni3PEzu
Absolute dreamland for England. In one burst from Archer and Woakes, they have reduced Australia to 15-3, and lifted their WinViz from 59% to 87%. #CWC19 https://t.co/xoV3o4e6iR
@harishkandpal Yep - but only slightly!
There's plenty to love about Jofra Archer, and whilst his pace draws the eye, his line is world class. 54% of his new ball deliveries in this World Cup have been the channel outside off - for comparison, even Jasprit Bumrah only manages 58%. #CWC19
Sometimes, luck comes back around. Against England in the group, Australia played a staggeringly high number of false shots, and yet their opening pair put together a match-winning partnership, riding their good fortune. Today, Finch and Warner's luck ran out. #CWC19 https://t.co/Bv9mvDDslW
What a battle. David Warner spanked his first ball from Woakes to the fence, then Woakes drew his length back. Then he gambled again, pitched it up, got spanked straight down the ground. Then Woakes went the other way, bowled his shortest ball of the day - and got Warner. #CWC19 https://t.co/kfdm8YFOUG
That's the first time this tournament that Jofra Archer's first ball would have gone on to hit the stumps. Immaculate start from the England quick. #CWC19
Aaron Finch had four centuries in his previous nine innings against England. A duck today, and a massive wicket for England. #CWC19
England are 59% favourites with WinViz. Australia have a 41% chance of victory. It's finely poised, it's a World Cup semi final - what a contest we have in waiting. #CWC19
In the last four British summers, England have only lost three matches when chasing; they *have* all come since the start of June 2019 though. #CWC19
The key to both Australian openers is to get the ball to move in. Since the last World Cup Finch averages 25 against in-seam. Across Warner's career he averages just 18 against balls swinging in on a good and full length. Get it full, get it coming in. #CWC19
The opening partnerships are going to be hugely significant today. In the tournament winning teams have averaged 69 for the first wicket and losing teams have averaged 20. Both Australia &amp; England have averaged 60+ for the first wicket. #CWC19
That is a big toss to win for Australia. The trend in this World Cup has favoured the team batting first. 64% of matches have been won by the defenders. #CWC19
