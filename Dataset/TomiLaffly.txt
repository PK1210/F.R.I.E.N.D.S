Turns out, West Side Story is filming in the part of Harlem I had lived for ~13 years (out of my 19 years total in Harlem.) And I'm sooooo going to take a stroll there tomorrow &amp; watch.

@ScottMendelson Nice try. https://t.co/iZzkY6D0QT
(ps: I won't hesitate to smash your car windows if I see a panting dog in there. Be-ware.) 😘
Forgive me for stating the obvious, folks. But the best thing you can do for your dogs today is leave them in your apartment, with AC on full blast. Short bathroom breaks only, etc.
@ScottMendelson I had one of my indisputably correct opinions. Guilty as charged! :)
You'd think people frequently on twitter would be better at recognizing (&amp; laughing at) tongue-in-cheek hyperbole. But NOPE. 😏

Maybe it's not exactly the same jacket, but who can say really?
Real talk, I found this fun jacket (faux fur obv) DIRT CHEAP at an outlet last winter. Sent the pic to @eal7nyc for his opinion. He hated it, I didn't buy it. Then....then I saw it on Sharon effing Horgan (whose style I look up to) in CATASTROPHE. I still regret my decision. https://t.co/fRFuqaWpan

Loads to process in Kirill Mikhanovsky's continually unpredictable and often heartbreakingly intimate GIVE ME LIBERTY, but what's certain is first-time actor Chris Galust exudes major young Leonardo DiCaprio vibes. The camera loves every angle of his face.
@mattprigge No worries at all. I have a pretty high threshold for just about anything other than dog deaths. xx
@mattprigge Just a couple of minutes in, and...I'm not supposed to be sober for this, am I?
@mattprigge The sequel is not available to stream. :(

@ezwrites I haven't revisited the original in ages. (Also, I didn't say it never happened before.)

@scottrenshaw It's just a strange pressure, like if you aren't stronger after something that broke you, are you inadequate? I don't think so.
Sorry for these random profound thoughts, but I feel increasingly bothered &amp; burdened by the emphasis we put on strength. What's so wrong with vulnerability sometimes?
They say what doesn't kill u makes u stronger. At 41 yrs of age, the most valuable thing I learned is, sometimes, it does the exact opposite of making you stronger. Sometimes, it takes certain resources away irreversibly. &amp; really, it's tough but okay to admit when that happens.
@thefilmcynic @mikeryan @davidehrlich I still watch cable like that. Just two days ago, I came across MONEYBALL like that &amp; remembered how much I love it (&amp; watched most of it.)
@kristapley @mikeryan @thefilmcynic I would fully support those channels for selects from the streamer's library and beyond.

@mikeryan Really good stuff. Remains to be seen if these streamer-owned movies we love will become a part of the cultural fabric without endless cable runs. But I have been wondering about this too and so glad you wrote about it.
So, when Audrey watches me intensely &amp; intently w/ her cute puppydog eyes, she's thinking hard about how much she loves me and like, how I'm just the best person in the entire universe, right? It better be the case, as this thought is the only thing that gets me going these days.
@bybowes Lol yes! :)

Real talk though, I'm not thrilled they didn't go with the stable home. I would've loved to see a mini horse in the end.

THE LION KING has this one frustrating &amp; needless plug for [REDACTED] that really, REALLY annoyed me. Think I audibly said "are you f'ing kidding me?!" Hope they are not testing the waters for a cinematic universe of some sort.
@kristapley Yeah...if they're going to waste 2 precious hours of my life, they better. Speaking on my own behalf only, Aladdin especially pissed me off.
Beyond the obvious 💰 thing, not sure why these live action remakes exist &amp; what they're supposed to do artistically. I'll patiently wait until 1 justifies its existence to me-hopeful for MULAN but THE LION KING wasn't it. Looked so bland &amp; flat, washing out emotions of the tale.
