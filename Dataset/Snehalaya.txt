CD4 count kits may be short special in 2 tier and 3 tier cities, leading to delay in investigation
@PreranaATC @CCDTrust In case of children requiring the 3rd line of ART, who are in critical conditions may be neglected in private as well as Govt hospitals. The staff and facilities provided by the Govt agencies is insufficient and the number of such critical patients remains high
@PreranaATC @CCDTrust Yes we still feel that HIV +ve children are the most neglected part of the society.
Primarily the Govt agencies provide the 1st line of ART. The 2nd line ART may be insufficient and hence children suffer when they do not get the treatment.

@PreranaATC @CCDTrust •Not to talk or bombard about their illness &amp; medicines repeatedly
•Not to show extra concern or sympathy about their health
•Never make them feel that the prognosis is bad

Not to talk directly or abruptly about their HIV positive status specially in front of public

•Develop confidence in them that the treatment is going to ensure a healthy, purposeful &amp;fruitful and long life for them.
@PreranaATC @CCDTrust •Incidents in their past keep haunting them, eg… death or a chronic illness of parents
•Always keep comparing themselves with normal children in their schools or colleges and may develop an inferiority complex
•
@PreranaATC @CCDTrust •Depressed children due to prolonged treatment and always have a question that when the treatment will end
•HIV +ve children staying in orphanages always have an apprehension whether they will be accepted by their immediate and extended family
