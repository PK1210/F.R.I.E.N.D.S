@13sbian Oh for sure but I do think one of the reasons that fascist-worship is so tacitly accepted in this country is the cultural messaging that emotions are untrustworthy and that level-headedness is the only path to truth.
One of the most disturbing scenes to me as a Brit is when a crew member on Good Morning Britain is being chummy with Bannon. It‚Äôs the kind of sycophantic behaviour we make fun of Piers Morgan for, but this culture of politeness-at-all-costs is pervasive in this country
I saw The Brink at Doc/Fest last month. Steve Brannon‚Äôs ilk has a way of turning mockery into a source of strength, and this film plays right into that, however unintentionally. I find it quite galling that so many professional critics see this film as a success.
