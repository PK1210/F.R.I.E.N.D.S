@Rahulshrivstv @AbdulMajeedSDPI @INCIndia Exactly, it is a shame that some would look at an anti terror law through the prism of  religion. It is these people who then link terror to a religion. Terror should be dealt with as such. Not through such blatant and shameful vote bank politics
@Uppolice Police investigation reveals in none of the above mentioned cases were muslims forced to say #JaiShriRam. None of it is mentioned that in their written complaint to the police. UP police chief is on record on @IndiaToday (Systematic campaign to malign a religion &amp; its believers?)
#Unnao (cricket issue), #Kanpur (Bike parking issue), #Aligarh (student didn't want to go to #Madrasa): @UPPolice. Commonality is fight between 2 groups but narrative of forced #JaiShriRam peddled. #Baghpat: #Maulvi not forced to say #JaiShriRam (Was it an orchestrated campaign?)
What do you mean ‚Äò‚ÄôMuslim MPs?‚Äô‚Äô They are all Indian Members of Parliament. It is a bill for action against terror. What Does @AbdulMajeedSDPI tweet reflect? What did he expect of Congress MPs and Muslim MPs...... https://t.co/lGTTE9nzDJ
The arrest of #HafizSaeed may be seen as a positive step once details and sections of the FIR are known and evidence produced in a court of law, seeking conviction for terror financing, planning and execution.

@fgautier26 Pak action against #HafizSaeed is not out of genuine concern to combat terror. It is for @ImranKhanPTI to show compliance before #FATF Sept deadline to #blacklist Pak approaches &amp; July 22 meeting with US president @realDonaldTrump. Pak will again bleed India moment pressure eases
@fgautier26 India defeated Pak in 1947-48 but #Nehru did not press home the advantage. 1971 Pak was split but #IndiraGandhi did not press for solutions. Vajpayee &amp; Manmohan Singh too did not push for Pak to dismantle that India centric Mil-Jihad terror complex. Let history not repeat itself.
@fgautier26 After defeating Mohd Ghori in the Battle of Terain, #PrithvirajChauhan made the big mistake of 'forgiving' the invader &amp; letting him go. A year later Ghori returned with a bigger army &amp; Chauhan was defeated. Aim must be to ensure enemy's capacity to bleed us is complete degraded.

India must not be satisfied with mere arrest of #HafizSaeed in a terror case &amp; not preventive detention.India must push for evidence based prosecution &amp; conviction in India centric terror cases &amp; dismantling of India centric Mil-Jihad complex. No #amankiasha till terror addressed
Pakistan has been cornered. But India must not suffer the #PrithvirajChauhan syndrome.

(Devil lies in detail)
@UN @IndiaToday @ImranKhanPTI July 3, top terrorists of #LeT/#JuD/#FiF booked for terror financing (Where not yet clear) &amp; money laundering. #HafizSaeed accused of building huge (Personal?) assets in Pakistan after collecting funds in the name of terror. 3 Trusts (terror funding fronts) `banned' by Pak. #FATF
@UN @IndiaToday @ImranKhanPTI #HafizSaeed arrested &amp; produced in #Gujaranwala anti-terror court. Hafiz charged with ``gathering funds for banned terror outfits''. Remanded to judicial custody.

@UN @IndiaToday @ImranKhanPTI #HafizSaeed leads a @UN designated terrorist organisation #LeT, #JuD #FiF.

@UN @IndiaToday #HafizSaeed is a strategic asset of the Pak Army. He has led #Eidnamaz @ #Gaddafistadium Lahore, attended #GHq #Iftaarparties. Unlikely to be abandoned in a hurry by Pak Mil-Jihad complex. This is an eyewash with #FATF Sept deadline approaching &amp; July 22 US visit of @ImranKhanPTI

@CestMoiz @ragarwal @UN Yes, all sources of terror must bleed. For far too long, terror was a low cost option for Pakistan. that rule must change. Pak mil jihad complex has sadly bled India, Afghanistan &amp; even US NATO forces with no institutional consequences. #balakot shook Pak but not enough to deter.
@ragarwal @CestMoiz US has a 10 million USD bounty on #HafizSaeed. But the opium of religion fueled terror prevents Pakistanis from acting against the @UN designated global terrorist. India must show the resolve &amp; neutralise the threat. Terror must bleed at source and constantly.
India of 2019 is different. Markets decide which language is more in demand. At least we have moved on from the Baba-Log generation that took pride in not knowing Hindi. But Hindi needs more focused attention &amp; nurturing to make it a natural preferred language of communication.
Hindi is a beautiful language. Thanks to films, TV, radio &amp; songs it is understood &amp; appreciated from Kashmir to Kanyakumari &amp; from Arunachal to Gujarat. Hindi binds us together beautifully as one of the many &amp; popular languages of India. Happy to see Hindi footprint increase.

Pak has in the past followed a set path. When global pressure mounts, it reduces support to terror. Hides terrorists &amp; gets alms. The moment international attention is diverted Pak is back to its dirty terror tricks. this time world must ensure terror &amp; terrorists are neutralised
This phrase Kangali mein aata Geela, so aptly describes Pak double whammy (‡§ï‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§ü‡§æ ‡§ó‡•Ä‡§≤‡§æ) But the world must continue to put pressure on Pak to abandon the path of being a global terror sponsor. A US soldier was killed in Afghanistan today by the Taliban, sponsored by Pak.
Pakistan ordered to pay 6 billion USD as penalty by an International Tribunal (plus both Honda &amp; Toyota are reducing number of work days as Pak auto market collapses) sadly even now Pak army's obsession with Terror (In India &amp; Afghanistan) remains intact.
https://t.co/yqOyOysNuD
By replacing one Khalistan terror supporter with another, Pak has exposed its evil gamelan to use #KartarpurCorridor to fan the #Khalistan fire. India cannot afford to fall into Pak trap just trying to be politically &amp; diplomatically correct. India should proactively counter Pak https://t.co/FJtb98Keb2

@Naveed99350793 @P_Musharraf Muslim army? Are you for real?? Well your '' Muslim army '' (as u put it) soldiers were buried with full Islamic rites by Hindu soldiers and a Maulvi on Kargil heights as your '' Muslim army'' chief @P_Musharraf chickened out and refused to accept '' Muslim army'' bodies. Wake up
@syed40215187 @RubikaLiyaquat If u can read, pls Google. How Nawaz Sharif went running to Clinton seeking a ceasefire. How Pak troops died hungry in Kargil.

India must demand accountability from Pakistan. Talk but after Pak takes action against perpetrators of terror attacks in India. If Pak bleeds India, bleed Pak more. #Kargil, 26/11 #Pathankot #Gurdaspur #Pulwama #neverforgiveneverforget Pak army treachery &amp; terror. #IndiaFirst
Pakistan lost the #Kargil war but returned to bleed India through terror. Attacked the Indian Parliament, temples, towns,  market places with no response from India. #Fai sponsored ecosystem &amp; #amankiasha types never demand accountability from Pak but advocate talks. Pak stooges.
Pakistan has repeatedly stabbed India in the back. In February 1999 then PM Vajpayee took the bus to Lahore to improve ties with Pak. That's the time Pak army was intruding into Kargil. Lying two faced snakes. We lost 550 braves to restore LoC. #NeverForgiveNeverforget
20 years after Pakistan army was defeated &amp; thrown out of #Kargil, I report on tales of unparalleled valour from the #Tololing peak, India's first victory at #Drass. After TOLOLING, Gen @P_Musharraf's plan began to collapse. He had no plan B (in this pic with Army Cdr &amp; officers) https://t.co/rw1iQ4Hbm2
@crawling_hills It was surreal. To see the exact spot where Maj Vivek Gupta, Maj Rajesh Adhikari Lt Col Vishwanathan &amp; others made the supreme sacrifice 20 years ago. Imagine the level of their courage. To climb in the dark, facing enemy gunfire &amp; hostile environment &amp; then launching the attack.
@kluzener Either ways, it is a killer without proper acclimatisation. Climbing up takes a toll on both heart and lungs along with the feet. Climbing down is tough on knees and thighs. So fitness is a must physical, mental, emotional and spiritual too.

@rajgopalnb So many of them sir. Initial operations that did not succeed...where braves like Maj Rajesh Singh Adhikari, Lt Col Vishwanathan and others fought like Tigers and made the supreme sacrifice and the final assault that was led by Maj Vivek Gupta
@AninBanerjee Our men and women in combat are the real stars. I am just fortunate to be able to see them in action and report on their valour, commitment and sacrifices.
@PassionForNews Yes, the peak where The Indian army got its first victory in Kargil on the night of June 12-13, 1999. When a 100 guns boomed together. Where brave soldiers charged at the Paki intruders with a battle cry of Bol Raja RamChandra ki Jai. Where many braves made the supreme sacrifice
@Chopsyturvey @rwac48 @keshda @PMOIndia @IndiaToday @AmitShah Raids on separatists &amp; Pak proxies have been on for some time now.
