Heartbreaking. Never in our life will we see a game as great as that again. Drama, emotion, skill and respect. Thank you Nz and thank you England. ❤️ @ Lord's Cricket Ground https://t.co/0NFTvtYF2l

@piersmorgan Lock me in! 💪🏼
But when they do...only 2 teams have successfully chased 250 or greater in this World Cup so far. And none of them in the pressure cooker of Semi finals! Cheers KP! Well batted the other day too 🤷‍♂️ 😂😂😂😂@piersmorgan https://t.co/6KoXsr4Zp3
Around 250 would never be enough in a bilateral series between these two teams on this surface but in a World Cup semi final....it may just be! 🧐

@MClarke23 You’re just growing the World game bud! We all appreciate it! 😂😂😂🤙🏼
Great insight from @MClarke23 on comms on how to beat Australia. “Assume the game is only going 35 overs, dominate them, attack them early, don’t be scared to take them on. Be prepared to attack with your best bowlers”. “Keep going for wickets!” Love it. 💪🏼 #SpendYourResource!
Approx 73% strike rate until now. 
Which is probably a little less than I thought but not too bad. Worth a go anyway! While we are at it, NZ will beat Aussie in the Semi final 🤙🏼 https://t.co/vcsoixOojU

Not so sure. One thing picking the team but the real key I think is getting the right team ready to play the game of their lives! https://t.co/1aCwI3DZaU
@juniorwaugh349 Guptill,Taylor,Williamson possess the games to combat anyone on there day and are big match players. Southee, Boult combo can be lethal and we can field with the best of them. If NZ, Find that swagger, take the game on then play the music how the music was meant to be played 💪🏼
I think NZ also. But it’s imperative they rediscover a bit of swagger, include Southee for his leadership &amp; also be prepared to take risks and force the game. Take on the short ball &amp; be more proactive against spin. If they get on top, then roll the dice with big guns &amp; ATTACK!💪🏼 https://t.co/HcXyjVzWQV

Impressive performance from @BCBtigers to defeat @OfficialCSA. I expected SA to win but Bangladesh played well. In regards to my predictions, thanks for the feedback on getting this one wrong. Won’t be the last but average at the end will look alright I think. Can’t win em all 😉
This WC analysis is IMO how the tournament will unfold. I would like nothing more for the growth of the game to have Afgh,Bang &amp; SL to be serious contenders in this WC. If the tournament was in Asia, they may well have been. But it’s early summer in the Uk, hence my predictions.
Couldn’t split WI v SL so have them both a win! ☺️
World Cup game by game predictions. 
4 teams will fight out the 4th qualifying spot and net run rate will decide who progresses. Rain and luck will likely play a part as well. I hope Nz gets that little bit of luck… https://t.co/EKDYsZZQ9m
