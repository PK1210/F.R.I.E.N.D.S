“We have no obligation to make history,” ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner said. “We have no obligation to make art. We have no obligation to make a statement. To make money is our only objective.”

With that delightful thought in mind, I rank Disney's remakes

https://t.co/gEs3GHjzS8 https://t.co/3DyxLnvuUm
After watching the Hindi #LionKing, I couldn't help but notice how insidiously it played into regressive cultural stereotypes. 

While Simba sounds like a SoBo kid, the hyena henchmen sound like Bihari goons. 

I wrote about it, for @htTweets:

https://t.co/fKfFQgOQDH https://t.co/Yeils5MlF8
.@sujoy_g serves up a nostalgic ghost story that should appeal to fans of old-fashioned mysteries, as well as those that have grown up on the Conjuring films. I sincerely hope it finds its audience.

My @htTweets review of his Netflix series, #Typewriter:

https://t.co/vWxnQq1rTJ https://t.co/8MkrkiAFHR
Disney’s latest, big-budget remake is a narratively bankrupt, towering monument to Hollywood excess. It’s also the greatest visual effects spectacle since Avatar.

I'm split about #TheLionKing. My ⭐️⭐️⭐️ @htTweets review:

https://t.co/RTwIIlVk6t https://t.co/CUfisCY2g2
The new #LionKing  is like a deeply triggering DisneyNature documentary, here to traumatise a new generation of fans and make money while it's at it. But that's the circle of life I guess.

That being said, it's the greatest achievement in visual effects since perhaps Avatar. https://t.co/D4rISMX0it
As someone who's grown up on Enid Blyton, Tintin, Feluda and Spielberg, @sujoy_g's new Netflix series #Typewriter brought back such fond memories.

I know the buzz has been rather lowkey, but that should be a bigger reason for you to seek it out on July 19. https://t.co/up54okBnI6
Danny Boyle's latest film is unlike anything he's done before, and another winner in a truly remarkable filmography. Absolutely irresistible.

Here's my 4.5-star @htTweets review of #Yesterday:

Legit panicking now. We’re only about a week from release and this is basically the first time we’ve heard Donald Glover’s voice. And still no shots of Simba’s mouth moving.

11 years, 23 films, $22 billion and (I love you) 3000 minutes later; at the end of the Infinity Saga, I rank every film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for @htTweets. Agree? Disagree?

#SpiderManFarFromHome is a passable postscript to Avengers: Endgame, but a marvellous ode to Tony Stark.

https://t.co/99w1gLN6Pq https://t.co/2mJ9iiCM7y
Just watched a Paul Thomas Anderson movie on my phone. Didn't turn off notifications or anything. Never felt dirtier. #ANIMA https://t.co/DbrBMZxgha
With its unambitious jump scare-heavy tactics, the Conjuring Universe has ruined mainstream horror movies, at least for the foreseeable future. For better or for worse, #AnnabelleComesHome is more like Conjuring 2.5. 

My review, for @htTweets: 
https://t.co/uXzFxHKYJk https://t.co/dJDRaj2y1s
A classic example of institutionalised Indian classism.

30 shops were gutted, resulting in lakhs and lakhs in losses - all probably because of poor safety precautions and lax enforcement of laws. 

But god forbid some folks get late for work. https://t.co/Ls5jjFq5Sm
A near-perfect sequel to a near-perfect series of films. 4.5/5.

Here's my @htTweets review of #ToyStory4:
https://t.co/UMaAK6JU85 https://t.co/81wLorjPqc
YOU HAVE ALREADY WON. https://t.co/nYEXgdbesY
I'm late to the party, but glad I made it.

My ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ @htTweets review of Netflix and @ava's #WhenTheySeeUs, a heartbreaking, but ultimately hopeful story about injustice and perseverance: 
https://t.co/PwEj1pwImi https://t.co/pkrCBHmPHl
Every time I begin to lose my patience with Netflix's all-encompassing slate of *content* I'm reminded of the God's work they are doing by shows like #WhenTheySeeUs.

That final episode is @ava's greatest creative accomplishment. #BradfordYoungBaybeeee! https://t.co/keduxRt3Vn
10 episodes. 13 hours. A lifetime of emotional trauma. 

Here's my @htTweets review of Nicolas Winding Refn's game-changing Amazon Prime series, #TooOldToDieYoung, out now on @PrimeVideoIN:

https://t.co/TOmJKhfvoq https://t.co/6PXEHR8Itj
Snorted all 13 hours of #TooOldToDieYoung today. Felt like puking only a couple of times.

It wasn't made available for preview; most of the reviews seem to be based on the two episodes that were screened at Cannes. 

Verdict after watching all 10: #NWR is (still) a sick genius! https://t.co/Wmoa4QuZ9A
I’m glad to see so many of you are watching #Leila and having a nice debate about it.

But remember, in addition to being about political and social collapse, it’s first and foremost a show about environmental collapse.

If you’re going to boycott something, let it be plastic.
Unfunny, unmemorable and utterly unnecessary; watching #MenInBlackInternational feels like returning to a famous chef's restaurant and learning that they died, years ago.

My review, on @htTweets: https://t.co/yhTswEg9io https://t.co/9Urtd7VO1i
And finally, I get to talk about the show I've been wanting to talk about for days...

Here's my ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ @htTweets review of #Leila, @NetflixIndia's most courageous show yet, starring @humasqureshi, @Actor_Siddharth, @R_Khanna. 

https://t.co/tXdJGyLyQz https://t.co/8CQJwYWmfa
Hilary Swank said debutante director Grant Sputore reminded her of a young Christopher Nolan. That's generous, but his film certainly reminded me of Ridley Scott and James Cameron's early work.

My review of the fantastic #IAmMother, out now on Netflix:
https://t.co/Sztw31X6J8 https://t.co/0gh1GPsHbt
In Netflix's #Leila, the authoritarian leader of a divided nation is fondly called 'Joshiji' by his followers. There are cartoons made about his youth, masks are made of his face.

I spoke to Huma Qureshi and Deepa Mehta about tyrants, among other things:

https://t.co/kfTNMSXiyJ https://t.co/vMscNmOXy5
I've had a few days to think about it, and @NetflixIndia's #Leila is, IMO, one of the most courageous and necessary works of fiction I've seen recently; thrilling &amp; timely. Can't wait for the chowkidaars to check it out.

Way to stick it to the man, @humasqureshi, @IamDeepaMehta. https://t.co/CWlCPO09sE
#DarkPhoenix is the worst film in the path-breaking X-Men saga; dispassionately performed, sloppily written, and gratingly scored. 

It made me wish for the days of Bryan Singer, and that's unforgivable.

My review, for @htTweets: https://t.co/iAPxAw846K https://t.co/ftiu5TIPlR
As critical as Charlie Brooker is of our reliance on technology, he is himself inseparable from it. Oddly, it’s similar to the relationship between creator and critic - neither would exist without the other.

My @htTweets review of #BlackMirror Season 5:  https://t.co/qwje6vtSMZ https://t.co/2yDL5WMQ7g
We may no longer be in Gorbachev’s USSR; but we’re just worshipping different masters now. Some of them have orange skin, others wear orange clothes.

Amazon's #GoodOmens is a lavish but frustrating adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's book. I amused (and depressed) myself mostly by drawing parallels to our real life situation.

#ThePerfection is precisely the sort of film that gets lost in a glut of mediocrity these days. We will watch what we are told to watch - either by corporations or by algorithms. I am neither. So, please watch The Perfection. 

My 4.5/5 @htTweets review: https://t.co/1CgK6LDKbJ https://t.co/VWn5X5bTcb
If you’re looking for films in which a superpowered child grows up to become a moody murderer, you’re better off watching Looper, or, heck, even Man of Steel.

Here's my @htTweets review of Guy Ritchie's #Aladdin (and no, Will Smith no longer looks like chewed up bubble gum)
 
https://t.co/dnRBttJt8S https://t.co/Vvlzquj6ra
Legit concerned if they're going to rename #Aladdin Valmiki or something now.
And so, in a couple of decades, a #JonSnow defender will be given the BJP ticket from Bhopal.
It navigates between high brow cinema and schlocky garbage like no one’s business. There are references to Tarkovsky and Kurosawa; there are also scenes in which a dog bites a man in the crotch.

My @htTweets review of #JohnWick3:
https://t.co/R2piIFVgfq https://t.co/ZgmdWEUa9M
IMO the only way #JohnWick3 could've been better is if Keanu had somehow gotten his hands on a desi katta and gone and shot the CBFC in the nuts.
While y'all were complaining about Mad Queens and dragons, a different sort of Game of Thrones was unfolding on HBO.

https://t.co/B5GLhjEwT2 https://t.co/gTX1PHbkOm
#DetectivePikachu cured me of my millennial angst. It also advised me on where to invest my savings and made me a nice dinner. https://t.co/alqDenHarF
@shrishti_03 Ahhhhhh don't even get me started on Jon Snow. That's what's annoying me about the show now. It's all grand posturing and speechifying. Where's the delicate intrigue? I think they've dropped the ball on this season.
@shrishti_03 Of course, but to hinge her entire existence on her past is a poor story decision. We hear her say that she’s changed; her body language is different, her speech is more authoritative. But what has she *done*?

I feel they’re building up to a clash we neither expected nor want.
Yeah, she’s definitely not a little bird anymore. 

She’s a petty, gossipy nag who credits her evolution to sexual assault. 

Oh #GameofThrones, when’ll you stop hating #Sansa?
You guys, Luca Guadagnino's #Suspiria is out on @PrimeVideoIN - and I'm not even a little bit surprised it made no money and everyone *hates* it.

That being said, please watch it.

I can already feel 'I love you 3000' becoming this generation's 'Why so serious'. But together, we can get through this.
The MCU, in this moment, has given us a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Cherish it. Hold it dear. Whatever it takes.

My review of #AvengersEndgame, for @htTweets: 
https://t.co/eyAirGLcTm https://t.co/TemrMZCCqy
Ahead of #AvengersEndgame, I defend one of the most underrated (and lowest-grossing) Marvel movies ever, Captain America: The First Avenger.

And I do it (partly) by comparing Steve Rogers to Pragya Thakur. (Not in an icky way).

https://t.co/OS4vKMMECS https://t.co/JchxJpGlll
When all is said and done, and #Thanos has recovered from his colonoscopy, only a handful of #Marvel movies will be remembered. The rest will simply congeal into a mass of spandex.

One day there'll be a Conjuring movie set in India, in which a Baba Ramdev type, armed with a rudraksh and a nimble body, will neutralise the threat by feeding it a pack of instant noodles.

https://t.co/ePg0dNsWKn https://t.co/zyeU1xJfNe

The only movie you need to watch this week is the Academy Award-winning #FreeSolo, a staggering cinematic achievement, out in select theatres. Drag your friends, go alone, cancel plans. #WhateverItTakes.

After #Shazam, here's my ranking of the DCEU's (very, very diverse) slate of films:

https://t.co/qdlktyWtW9

Wonder Woman&gt;Shazam&gt;Man of Steel&gt;Aquaman&gt;Suicide Squad&gt;Justice League&gt;Batman v Superman https://t.co/ewYTxfVqgh
As a fan of #TheNightOf, I admired @hotstartweets' #CriminalJustice remake. 

It relies on its actors to do the heavy lifting. And fortunately, @masseysahib, @TripathiiPankaj and especially @bindasbhidu, are tremendous.

My @htTweets review: 
https://t.co/alfBSYziR6 https://t.co/3t7NuxjAx1
As the DCEU emerges from an abusive past, so does Billy Batson.

#Shazam is their journey of rediscovery, and also the best DC film since Wonder Woman.

My ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️@htTweets review:

https://t.co/7Fe24QLLrR https://t.co/CAdrX1R21y
#Shazam is a Mr India remake and nothing you have to say can change my mind.
HBO's new true crime series tries to solve the murder mystery that Serial couldn’t.

My review of #TheCaseAgainstAdnanSyed:

https://t.co/Q1dbmgUZkW https://t.co/BzdskuS1EH
The newfound success of the DCEU is also a sign that serviceable mediocrity will always be favoured over pure ambition.

But after #Shazam, does the DCEU even need Batman and Superman anymore?

My take: https://t.co/OL4mjsXvD7 https://t.co/wPvD4YqZCU
In an age when there's daily discourse on police brutality and mass shootings, Netflix's #TheHighwaymen decides that now is the best time to tell the story of a couple of policemen who emptied 130 rounds into two twenty-somethings.

#DelhiCrime is the best @NetflixIndia original series since Sacred Games. 

It is also one of the finest true-crime dramas I have seen in months - gut-wrenching, sensitively directed and passionately performed.

My ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ @htTweets review: 
https://t.co/Ud0oa0E9N0 https://t.co/NCQvKcivlS
Possibly the coolest thing about Netflix's #DelhiCrime is that writer/director/creator Richie Mehta depicts Delhi like the damn dystopia that it is.

The show opens with a #BladeRunner homage for gods sake!

#TripleFrontier is one of the best examples of what a 'Netflix original film' can be - a wickedly entertaining ride that balances a populist approach with an auteur-driven identity. I had a blast.

My ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️@htTweets review:

https://t.co/BMvC6wnCdx https://t.co/8JMiGoX8VW
As a Delhiite. As a dude. As a dude who has grown up in Delhi and has complication emotions about Delhi... Netflix's #DelhiCrime is phenomenal.

#TripleFrontier is an insanely entertaining movie. It constantly keeps reinventing itself every 10 minutes - drug drama --&gt; heist movie --&gt; Western --&gt; chase film. INSANE.

#GullyBoy isn't a movie about rap. Murad could just as easily have been a boxer.

"We laboured the last six months in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,” said #JamesCameron. 

He was talking about Titanic.

#AlitaBattleAngel is a reminder that we should never count him out.

#ColdPursuit is both a parable on the emptiness of revenge and a snarky takedown of the sort of movies #LiamNeeson has been making for the last decade. Couldn't have liked it more.

"A bad review is better than sinking into the great glut of anonymity," Jake Gyllenhaal's character says in #VelvetBuzzsaw. There's an element of truth in that.

Here's my ⭐️⭐️ @htTweets review of #EscapeRoom:

https://t.co/9AphTdIRNN https://t.co/0VNItSi41o
#Polar somehow transforms a simple globe-trotting montage into the most ill-advised instance of the glorification of an obsolete Indian custom since Padmaavat.

It's one of the worst Netflix original movies I've ever seen.

My ⭐️ @htTweets review:

https://t.co/KVe4khf12z https://t.co/irYCsTYhSB
I think Joe Berlinger is the pioneer of modern true crime. 

But his new Netflix series, #ConversationsWithAKiller,  takes only a half-hearted stab at understanding #TedBundy, perhaps the most infamous serial killer of all time.

My review, for @htTweets:

https://t.co/powgH9d4hW https://t.co/zv67x9tByP
I didn't watch #FourMoreShotsPlease, but @soumya1405 brought perspective and insight I don't have in her excellent review:

Easily my most anticipated movie of the year. Like, by far.

Well done Black Panther and Roma, but the #OscarNoms this year were especially disappointing.

Here's my take, for @htTweets, in which I mostly whine about #FirstMan and #ThreeIdenticalStrangers and #MissionImpossibleFallout:

https://t.co/DWaOXxe9ak https://t.co/xxk0rKfsTt
#MissionImpossibleFallout (Best action film of the year)
#Hereditary (Best horror film of the year)
#Annihilation (Best science-fiction film of the year)
#EighthGrade (Best directorial debut of the year)

Amazing films, no?

Zero #OscarNoms between them.
And the Academy Award for the biggest snub of 2019 goes to... Justin Hurwitz for #FirstMan

So after #Glass, here's my ranking of every M Night Shyamalan movie.

Treat this not as another dismissal of Glass but an opportunity to defend The Last Airbender and The Village:

https://t.co/i9LXs01FcM https://t.co/wYxRkRiufQ
Is it a meta-commentary on comic book movies? An attempt by M Night Shyamalan to make his own Avengers-style universe? Or is it a knowing wink at his own career?

#Glass fails on all 3 accounts, and others.

My ⭐️⭐️ @htTweets review:

https://t.co/hJeAGQpSak https://t.co/yGU0Qgue3U
Netflix pops 2019's cherry with its best new show in many months. 

#SexEducation is fantastic; a heartfelt, sweeping romantic comedy that firmly announces itself as one of the best the genre has to offer.

My review 4.5/5 @htTweets review:

https://t.co/TnkNO4BO8x https://t.co/09jMxtQHep
While everyone flips out about #GullyBoy - rightly so - would like to take the opportunity and remind everyone that @JosephKahn's #Bodied (produced by Eminem) is one of the best movies of 2018 and the perfect thing for you to watch ahead of @RanveerOfficial and @aliaa08's film. https://t.co/sw3cB6oK32
If you've ever wondered what Yorgos Lanthimos' version of Keeping Up With the Kardashians would look like, #TheFavourite is going to be the best movie you've ever seen.

Sort of like the second cousin once removed to Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette. https://t.co/7zIspjCR1O

@chhabs The 20-minute episodes were a blessing!
“The Slumdog (Millionaire) version is presented all the time outside,” said #SelectionDay writer Marston Bloom, admitting that Danny Boyle's film was fundamental to his understanding of India.

It shows.

My ⭐️⭐️ @htTweets review of Netflix's latest:
https://t.co/8KwgDTELwB https://t.co/g2JXU2szD0
Disappointed to report that I didn’t like Netflix’s #SelectionDay. 

In addition to being produced on the cheap, it appears to have been made by a bunch of guys who understand neither India nor cricket. 

20-minute episodes are always a win, though. 

It’s out Friday... https://t.co/gbUAAYvFgK
It's less wonky than The Happening and not quite as thrilling as A Quiet Place, but Netflix's #BirdBox is an effective ensemble movie, featuring a movie star performance by Sandra Bullock.

#BadTimesAtTheElRoyale is great fun. Stunningly shot, cleverly written and very Tarantino-esque.

Also has a version of the 'Basanti inn kutton ke saamne mat naachna' scene, so I've decided that Drew Goddard is a Sholay fan. But who isn't? https://t.co/WPB7RtnHXE

The dick remains uncut.

In the first of my year-end countdowns, I list the 5 most underrated Hindi films of 2018, for @htTweets: 

https://t.co/WDvijavpxt https://t.co/FJdzFyHRNX
As much as I adore opening credits sequences, the most cathartic moment of any movie - for me - is if/when the title comes up at the end. 

Few have had the impact of #Roma. 

@AlfonsoCuaron leaves room for reflection, gives you time to consider what you've seen. Bravo, maestro. https://t.co/ryL7RVEYuQ
I've always had a soft spot for the #DCEU - so after the refreshingly entertaining #Aquaman, here's my RANKING of EVERY FILM in the DC Extended Universe:

https://t.co/W5Dy5Kja7R https://t.co/qKX4Anzpgi
@ruhinchatterjee https://t.co/jeiaY01XPY
James Wan just saved the DCEU from drowning.

#Aquaman is vibrant fun - equal parts Game of Thrones and Indiana Jones; like Black Panther told from Killmonger's perspective.

Here's my 3.5/5 @htTweets review:

https://t.co/oUdGwiiGlG https://t.co/30Gw54J7Kl
Things that happen in #Aquaman:

1. Jason Momoa takes selfies with strangers. 

2. A giant 🐙 plays the drums. 

3. James Wan needle drops a rap version of Toto’s Africa. Before a sequence set in Africa. 

Verdict: https://t.co/WlIzGCy92M
Before #IntoTheSpiderVerse, here's my ranking of the #SpiderMan movies, for @htTweets:

https://t.co/xKHCK6GyGL https://t.co/VDhPu9dyuG
#ThreeIdenticalStrangers is the best documentary film of 2018. 

It is also one of the best *films* of 2018. 

There will be no debating this. 

Reminded me of @markromanek’s Never Let Me Go; heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. 

#YKW. https://t.co/UzCmGe5Nin
With one month to go this year, this is everything I watched in November. 

Watched Mowgli and Fantastic Beasts twice, loved Shirkers and Creed II. Hated every minute of Mirzapur. https://t.co/DCBD6pc3SV
@VikramMotwane @boburnham @eighthgrademov @A24 @ElsieKFisher https://t.co/D8AL7I1TyL
No other movie this year has announced that it is a stone cold masterpiece quicker than #EighthGrade. 

30 seconds in and I knew it was special. 

I could watch it forever, on a loop. 

As far as 2018 feature debuts go, it’s @boburnham, Ari Aster, Jennifer Fox, Bradley Cooper. https://t.co/DkjlSedjRz

If Creed was almost as good as Rocky, then #Creed2 is almost as good as Creed.

Here's my 4.5/5 @htTweets review:

https://t.co/y8k58W6pLy https://t.co/BMXiOP1zy6
The #Netflix logo was met with whoops at the #Mowgli world premiere. But guess what: It was a different logo.

Gone was that iconic ‘ba-dumm’ in favour of a sleek new design (and new fanfare).

Theory: As Netflix experiments with theatrical release, this is the logo they’ll use.
@VignitionCquens Certainly not a remake. More like an impressionistic take. Takes the elements that we know so well and explores the roots of what makes the story universal.
@Sanyamvarun @Tintin Embarrassingly.
@shrishti_03 Very soon! By next week, a few days before release hopefully!
Guess what? I interviewed Christian Bale, Andy Serkis, Freida Pinto and Rohan Chand for #Mowgli - a movie that I genuinely like - and there's video evidence to prove it!

Batman and Tintin are both hugely important to me. So this was meaningful in more ways than one. https://t.co/IPUiFqNJmC
Just asked #AndySerkis about that goddamned #Tintin sequel. 

For what it’s worth, he seems to really want to make it. 

“I know there is an appetite for it among fans,” he said. “And I know Peter (Jackson) really wants to make it.”

Nothing new, but an update nonetheless

🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼 https://t.co/v8JnoFKLmb
#Mowgli, due out on #Netflix on December 7, is not for everyone.

But it will speak to those for whom it is intended.

Pity very few will be able to experience it on the big screen. It’s so clear that’s how it was meant to be seen.

Here’s a pic from the world premiere. https://t.co/DlmyjkTf4w

#Shirkers, on @Netflix, is unbelievably good.

It's either about a wizard who inspires people to follow their dreams, or about a conman who goes from town to town, robbing them of their spirit.

Best movie about movies since... umm... Argo? https://t.co/hUO6Ea3P6U

#TheCrimesOfGrindelwald can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a #FantasticBeasts sequel or a #HarryPotter prequel.

https://t.co/rJpz4Qw2SC https://t.co/KNVvaqPkgv
The more I think about #Mirzapur, the more I dislike it.

It's an immature, irresponsible and unoriginal series that even the great Pankaj Tripathi couldn't save.

https://t.co/4Glkhs08Eo https://t.co/MJWwESU8OV
Here’s the crucial difference between #NarcosMexico and #Mirzapur; what makes one very good and the other immature, despite similarities.

The world (especially India and Mexico) is a violent, unforgiving place.

Art has a responsibility to condemn this culture.

They’re out Fri
Finished watching #Mirzapur today. It is what it is. Discount Anurag Kashyap. But Pankaj Tripathi's great.

If only the show didn't have the maturity of a rowdy teenager - too much needless violence, told with zero nuance. Hardly Amazon's answer to Sacred Games.

Out Nov 16. Meh. https://t.co/LqcoNWhzpV
Asked #RobinWright if they ever considered a version of the #HouseOfCards ending in which Claire died. 

She said yes. In fact, they had three possible endings mapped out. 

They made the final decision after half the season was locked.

I’m guessing option 3 was an alliance.
