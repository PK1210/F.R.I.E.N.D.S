Diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection. It is the balancing of risk. 

So far, the administration has consciously chosen a dangerous path leading to a riskier future. But diplomacy is still the only way for the administration to climb out of the hole they‚Äôve dug.
As I said after the Iran deal was reached, it was not perfect but it achieved its fundamental mission of blocking every pathway for Iran to get a bomb.
By withdrawing from the deal, the administration has effectively broken up the international coalition that was unified in constraining Iran, and now Iran is once again increasing its nuclear capability.
When the Trump administration threatened to pull out of the Iran deal and impose more sanctions last year, it was clear that we'd lose our leverage and Iran would be free to do what it wanted. 

Predictably, Iran is now exceeding enrichment limits the deal once imposed.

After a decade of amazing progress in combating deaths from malaria, progress has leveled off over the past few years. Malaria is an entirely preventable disease that kills a child every two minutes. This #WorldMalariaDay, let's renew our collective efforts to end it.
Robert Mueller's report documents a serious crime against the American people. All Americans should demand action and accountability.

A piece of good news for reproductive rights: A judge has blocked the administration‚Äôs Title X gag rule. ‚ÄúAt the heart of these rules is an arrogant assumption that the government is better suited to direct women‚Äôs healthcare than their providers.‚Äù Indeed. https://t.co/sr8NhkUtdh
Adding a citizenship question to the Census would undoubtedly lead Latino and other residents to avoid responding. The resulting count would be inaccurate, unfair, and unrepresentative‚Äîa failure of democracy with real consequences for states and communities.
This is despicable. The Trump administration is not only ceding America‚Äôs role as a leader on the human rights of women, it‚Äôs actively working against those rights. We all have to work together to right this wrong and undo this damage. https://t.co/L5IWLLy2eB

This #EarthDay, I'm thankful for the millions of young people around the world who have marched and gone on strike to demand action on climate change. 

We know what we need to do: Cut greenhouse emissions in half by 2030. Now we need to do it.
On this holy weekend for many faiths, we must stand united against hatred and violence. I'm praying for everyone affected by today's horrific attacks on Easter worshippers and travelers in Sri Lanka.
Wishing love, hope, and renewal to everyone celebrating Easter today.
To all who are celebrating, chag Pesach sameach!
