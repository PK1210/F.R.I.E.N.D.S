@backandacross Last time in a game with an outright result was in 1999 Sussex v Derbyshire. Today was the 2nd time since 1920 for Surrey, the other being v Glamorgan at Cardiff Arms Park in1966.
@DutchBirdKate You should definitely add that comment. The scorebook would be incomplete without it.
@GeoffLemonSport Hi Geoff. Good to know I am not the only person left In the world who still uses the keyboard to copy and paste!
Leicestershire v Gloucestershire is also the first in first-class cricket to have 3+ partnerships of 200+ of which at least two are 300+.
Leicestershire v Gloucestershire is the first match in first-class cricket with two innings where four of the top 7 in the order scored 0-9, one scored 50-99 and two scored 100+

https://t.co/MXM6vLAMHp
@ZaltzCricket That is correct. Three other times where openers were both out for exactly 100 are:
JB Hobbs/A Sandham Sur v Leics Oval 1930
CF Walters/HHIH Gibbons Worcs v Warks Kidderminster 1934
WM Lawry/CC McDonald Aus v Camb Univ Cambridge 1961
@BdJcricket Hi Bertus. I am a nobody who is actually bothered about the accuracy of scorecards. Please DM me to discuss.
Clarification .... https://t.co/bliZOkY3Sn
@mediumdobbers @DazRTaylor Correct. You have obviously read @TheCricketerMag 

But it seems as though the ECB is actually planning on lumping it with T20 and not List A one-day games (40+ overs) as was reported.
@andymcg_cricket The Hundred is essentially T20 with 5-ball overs. If it has to be lumped with an existing statistical category it should be T20. Then at least we are comparing red apples with green apples. Lumping it with 50 overs and we are comparing red apples with a cheese sandwich.
@markbutcher72 Yup!
@ed_rainsford Already more in this WC than all the others combined.
@markbutcher72 Reminiscent of Nottinghamshire's 2nd innings v Durham University in 2010:

@LiamCromar Thanks
@norcrosscricket @jsoverend I have noticed that.
@collinsadam @edwardscricket Robert Croft is the most recent England and Wales bowler to reach 1000 f-c wickets in 2007. A Caddick reached 1000 in 2005 and M Bicknell in 2004.
RT @TheCricketerMag: Cricket was played at 21 overs per hour up until the 1940s. It has lost roughly an over an hour each decade since. Shoâ€¦

@henrymoeranBBC @CharlesDagnall Hi Henry. Here are the lowest where known: https://t.co/stGWnCN515
@CharlesDagnall Hello Daggers. Here is the list I have. It is important to note that we do not have PPs for all T20s, so there are likely to be others that we don't know of. I currently have 9 825 PPs out of 14 834 inns. And this list is based on those: https://t.co/uLcDurxj4w
@CharlesDagnall This is not correct. 94 is joint 12th most that I have and I only have power play details for about 2/3 of all T20 matches. (106 Notts v Durham is the highest that I know of)
@blowersh Hello Henry. Angelo Perera made 2x200s in a first-class match in SL last week. Runners are more complicated, but if you are looking for a case where the batsman had a runner for his whole inns it is most likely 226* G Fowler (with runner) &amp; D Lloyd Lancs v Warks Southport 1982.
So â€¦ Arthur Fagg is no longer the only player with 2 200s in the same first-class match https://t.co/wQOMfWbdcX
100 on first-class debut and 100 on Test debut:
GR Viswanath (Ind), DM Wellham (Aus), PP Shaw (Ind)
100 on first-class debut and 100 in 2nd Test:
CN Frank (SA), DG Bradman (Aus), KH Weekes (WI), Pankaj Roy (Ind), MG Vandort (SL), KR Patterson (Aus)
Players who began their first 2 or more Test inns following a partnership of 150+:

Burns' 100 ends a sequence of 6 Tests without a century for Australia, their longest since they went 7 without a century in 1956 (5 v Eng, 1 v Pak, 1 v Ind).

163 (10th) PJ Hughes/AC Agar Aus v Eng Nottingham 2013 after 108-4 to 117-9
The Test at Brisbane is the first in Australia to finish in less than 5 days since the match v SA at Adelaide in November 2016. 12 consecutive Tests going 5 days is the longest such sequence in Australia since 13 between 1981 and 1983.
Most catches by a fielder off one bowler on Test debut:
4 RS Grant off EA Martindale WI v Eng Bridgetown 1935
4 Yajurvindra Singh off BS Chandrasekhar Ind v Eng Bangalore 1977

This Australian XI has a career total of 8 048 Test runs between them going into the match. This is the lowest career aggregate for an Australian XI going into a Test since December 1979 v India at Mumbai - 5 379.
Between Steve O'Keefe dismissing Wahab Riaz at Sydney in Jan 2017 and Jhye Richardson dismissing Chandimal today only 4 bowlers took wickets for Australia at home - Starc/Hazlewood/Cummins/Lyon took 150 between them in that time.

@tintin1107 Good spot - a beautiful innings! I am going to tweet the 3 such cases in all first-class cricket.
@gulu1959 @rickeyrecricket I suspect we may never find it. On the other hand, there might still be someone out there who has it and who notices these tweets.
Opening the batting &amp; bowling in a Test for England:
1877-1939: 35 times
Since 1945:
WJ Edrich v WI Manchester 1950
C Washbrook v NZ at Christchurch 1951
TE Bailey  - 5 times between 1954 &amp; 1957
GA Gooch v Pak Faisalabad 1987
MJ Leach v SL Pallekele 2018
@gulu1959 @rickeyrecricket Correct. There are some discrepancies of balls faced by Tendukar, but he faced ~ 29430 in the rest of his Test career &amp; certainly did not face 570 balls in the inns that is missing - he scored 11 in 92 mins in that inns.  PS If anyone has balls for that inns please let me know.
@rickeyrecricket Actually, while it is true that we don't have balls faced data for all Test innings, we do have enough to say with certainty that Dravid is the only player to have faced more than 30 000 balls.
First 6 batsmen in a Test inns scores in ascending order:
Aus v Eng Melbourne 1885
Aus v Eng Sydney 1933
WI v Eng Lord's 1957
Pak v SL Colombo SSC 2009
SL v Ind Kolkata 2017
Pak v NZ Abu Dhabi 2018
First 7 - never.
5 penalty runs against batting team in Tests:
Running on the pitch: 
Ban (Nasir Hossain) v WI Chittagong 2011 &amp; 
Ind (RA Jadeja) v NZ Indore 2016
Deliberate short run:
SL (ARS Silva) v Eng Pallekele 2018
@ZaltzCricket @dave_wood104 @TreasuryTutor This is true. It is complicated, so causes great havoc. There has also been some dispute as to whether Greig bowled off-spin or off-cutters. But, I must admit it does look like off-spin when he get Viv here:

#NoNobodyWillEverThinkOfTheStatisticians
The last time 4 spinners took a wicket in a Test innings for England before today was v India at Madras in 1962 (Lock, Allen, Parfitt &amp; Barber).
Most sixes in first 50 runs of Test innings without a 4:
5 Sam Curran today
3 Martin Guptill NZ v Bdesh Hamilton 2010
Sam Curran is the first player to reach each of his first 3 Test fifties with a six.
@norcrosscricket @GeoffLemonSport @collinsadam Retweeting @Charlie6735 - 16 March 1877 (from the Twitter archives)
165 retired hurt out of 245. Ha. They'll still be talking about it in 2018!
@norcrosscricket @GeoffLemonSport @collinsadam Not to mention his extraordinary foresight in knowing that his record will still be standing 141 years later!
Best bowling figures in a team total of 500+ for 7 or fewer wickets:

@deeputalks Hi Deepu. I see you've been reading my book!
Earliest dismissal by a keeper on Test debut:
2nd ball: P Nevill Aus v Eng Lord's 2015
2nd ball: B Foakes Eng v SL Galle 2018
R Woolley took a catch of 2nd legal ball Aus v SL 1983 but the 1st was a no ball.
WG Grace took a catch of his 1st ball as keeper but in his 5th Test
Vernon Philander had 140 first-class innings between his 2nd 100 (in 2009) and his 3rd (this week). Only 2 South Africans have had a longer gap between first-class 100s: 156 SR Harmer (2011-2018) &amp; 153 J Louw (2003-2012). World record is 449 by JB Mortimore (1955-1963).
@deeputalks @mohanstatsman @MazherArshad @statanalyst @RicFinlay @RVICricketStats @Benedict_B @gaurav_sundar @rgcricket @rajeshstats @Shiva_cricinfo There are a number of bowlers with more than one category, e.g GS Sobers, CR Miller, A Symonds etc, so OB/SLA. However if you are looking only at 'arm' he is neither 'right' or 'left', but the first to be 'both', or a 'switch' bowler.

@collinsadam No worries. If Aus do survive will you be able to get official minutes for Khawaja?
