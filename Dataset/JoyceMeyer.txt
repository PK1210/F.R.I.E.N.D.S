When you try to move forward your past is going to try and drag you back. Joyce encourages you with the truth that Jesus has already paid for your past. You don't have to pay for your past by giving up your future! #JoyceTeaching #GoodWord https://t.co/ImWIohZGAs

In 2017, volunteers from The Church TX, one of our partners in Hurricane Harvey relief, rescued many people from their flooded Houston homes. Thank you for helping us lend a hand to those in need! #HandOfHope #GiveHope https://t.co/Z680RiXziN
What are your gifts and talents? Do you know? Joyce shares a funny story of how she tried to do things that she wasn't gifted at. She encourages you to do what you're good at and become outstanding at it! #JoyceTeaching #GoodWord https://t.co/xa01QLkWtJ
God doesn‚Äôt want us to live timid, shy, weak, wimpy, fearful, boring lives. He wants us to be bold, confident, and courageous, unafraid to try new things. And it never ceases to amaze me what God will do through a person who simply steps out in faith. #JoyceQuote #BeBold https://t.co/4VcGUI3n9C
"I love my life." I dare you to say that every day of your life! üòâ #JoyceQuote #LoveYourLife
