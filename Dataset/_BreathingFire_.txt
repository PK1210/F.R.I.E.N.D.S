RT @ImRo45: Some rules in cricket definitely needs a serious look in.
LOUDER. https://t.co/0yqC6T6MSC
Dont think anybody 'like' the rules depending on which side of the line they are. They just dont mind it at that moment. Many rules of ICC are farse. There shouldn't be any debate regarding this. RULES NEED CHANGES. https://t.co/9NqR5lVZ6l

I've never loved any player more than Trent Boult. I will not love anyone more too. It breaks me. He's gonna face all the brunt for this. Its better to move on from him, NZ and cricket. Just too broken to watch this game again
@billz_25 THIS IS NOT
FUCK OFF @ICC JUST FUCK OFF
New Zealand has been robbed
 They've been cheated on. Tose overthrows should have never been allowed. I will never be able to watch cricket again. Never ever. It feels horrible
GUPTILL PLEASEEEEEE
WIN WIN PLEASE WIN
Archer wont conceed 16 ever. These kiwi batsmen wont score 16 ever
@IsSwingAndSeam I wont be able to see him getting all the abuses. This was fucking WC final. This is going down in history
@IsSwingAndSeam Dropped Stokes. He bottled
@IsSwingAndSeam He bowled garbage
Ferguson shpuld have been bowling 😭😭😭
TRENT 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ffs Trent is having a horrible day. Why him?
I hope Lockie is bowling.
Why that overthrow allowed? Kyu bencho? Stokes se lagi na ball...this is not done 😭

Umpiring errors har match k baad are only increasing aur yahan logon ko 'ye wala batsman nick karke chala gaya, ye wala nahi gaya' se hi fursat nahi milti 👀
That Kohli shouldn't have walked either. It was a chutiya decision. https://t.co/7eBfaTill6
@thasneem307 Have my positivity reached u too? 😂
@thasneem307 Kane gone. Ross gone. My panic button still off 😂
@thasneem307 Same. Lets just hope they get to 260 atleast 😂
RT @tickerscricket: Erasmus going full Dharmasena. Absolute scenes.
@thasneem307 Not against England. Esp if Roy/Bairstow gets going which they do mostly. They just hit.
@minakshinath @ICC I know. Everytime these decisions go under the carpet as teams used their review when it should only be called an umpiring error imo
This is what i feared https://t.co/fAMpWVSfyy
@IndianMourinho Also that chase against India at Wankhede. Top quality.
@thasneem307 It started again? 😍😂
@karthik_jammy ✌✌
@thasneem307 💪✌
@karthik_jammy Hopefully we dont end up crying
@thasneem307 Lets see. I am just very positive. This is mental 😂
@thasneem307 270-280 should be great
Not sure why i am so hopeful. Full of positive energy
@thasneem307 We're winning
Too much cry and hue for how the crowd is watching the match smh
No collapse please
Dharmasena though....lol
Go well, Rosco 👍

No. Great team &amp; consistency alone shouldn't get anyone a trophy. How a team hold their nerves in pressure situations &amp; play on that particular day should very much be a factor.
