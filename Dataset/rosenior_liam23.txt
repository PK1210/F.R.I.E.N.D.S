Interesting! Talking from a place of fear “losing the ball”.. “losing PL status”..no one philosophy is right in winning games but development of our players/coaches can still happen at first team level with a long term growth mindset over a short term fixed “fear” mindset... ⚽️ https://t.co/u64g8oWqWX
