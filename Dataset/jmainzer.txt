New Tool album, but no mention of the sexual assault allegations against Maynard James Keenan...not even in an "in case you forgot, last July, this happened" way that news articles do. Anonymous allegations, but many Reddit users shared similar stories...pretty surprised here
Catching @marklanegan and Simon Bonney tonight at @thebottomlounge but there are other great shows! @algreen at @ChicagoTheatre (with @warandtreaty opening) and Iceage and @NadahElShazly and No Men at @LincolnHall https://t.co/2cFi46vV6g
Interviewed @joni_void about his great new album Mise En Abyme (@cstrecords), which takes interpolations and samples of the human voice to a level that's at once unrecognizable and very personal/familiar. Also, he's unexpectedly a pop punk fan. https://t.co/EOhPhpB1oW

RT @jeremyslevin: Case in point of how GOP leadership--not just Trump--enable Islamophobic hate speech and death threats against Ilhan.

If there‚Äôs any better feeling than that confirmation that you‚Äôve successfully locked the bathroom, let me know
Today I have asked Google to play ‚ÄúOld Man‚Äù by Neil Young and ‚ÄúThe Boys Are Back In Town‚Äù and neither time has it responded ‚ÄúGo outside you fat idiot‚Äù I want my money back
RT @JuddLegum: 1. WTF is going on with Trump's social media accounts?

Let me explain in plain English.
RT @davidmackau: when will we in the media collectively stop framing these things as feel-good stories https://t.co/ADrstu4HIk
RT @MairavZ: A Palestinian mother and her baby have been killed.
Imagine if they were Israelis killed by a Palestinian rocket, how differen‚Ä¶
@bmainzer I don't really like any of the Dem nominees besides Warren but voting for the lesser of two evils is as American as apple pie. And yeah, if he's not removed, Trump is for sure going to win.
@bmainzer Also, you should feel lucky that you have "liked" who you've voted for in the past. It's clearly been a while since you've voted in a Chicago mayoral election.
@bmainzer Bernie certainly received help from Russia and has done nothing to turn it away, but he believes in the separation of powers in government, which is not something you can say about our current president. I think he'd be an ineffective leader but I'll still vote for him over Trump
@bmainzer Of course they're going to be rigged, but I'm still going to vote, and I'm going to vote for whoever is running against Trump
@bmainzer If you don't vote for the Dem nominee no matter who it is you're no better than those who voted 3rd party or stayed home in 2016
sometimes I watch Giannis doink a shot and think ehhh how good IS he and then he does a thing that makes me question whether he is human
