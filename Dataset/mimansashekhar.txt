Clutching on the sheet
Feeling the tears flow
Looking through the glass
Calmness of meadow
Bedside lamp flickering
Thoughts pushed in a cove
Is it the sorrow within
Or longing to feel loved
Eyes are heavy
Pillow is soaked
Coldness in the heart
Waiting for next day to bring hope!

Ripples in my flower pot

I let the naughty rain tease me
I know it's you reminding me to breathe free!

To call #Super30, @iHrithik’s most nuanced act in a long time won’t be wrong. He has put in a lot of hardwork to infuse life into the character of award-winning mathematician @teacheranand and his efforts are visible!

Here's my quick take on @super30film

@Sohanbansode @boomzy1231 @SiddhiSankalkar @DammnGirll @flor_enthus @emitoms @NamrataWakhloo @appadappajappa @arey_waah @YoursLegallyy "Lafzon mein usse ek din savar na zaroor hai...
Muskurahat mein uski humko nikharna zarur hai
Jo kashish ankhon se guzarke iss dil mein utarti hai
Uss nazaakat ko sametke hum pe bikharna zaroor hai..."

Adab arz hai! 😇

So many notifications and so sleepy to check all of them! Let's keep it for tomorrow. Forgive me friends, those who are involved! 🙂🙃✨

When you realise you are the admin of almost all the #WhatsApp groups you belong to! A responsibility or an uninvited authority? 😅🙃🤦
