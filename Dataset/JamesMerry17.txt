@AVFCTransTweet May come back to bite me, but I can see Hogan being a revelation this year. I saw somebody earlier calling Davis sulky and disinterested; only 21 and living his dream after signing from Biggleswade, why on earth would he be unhappy?? Sometimes it‚Äôs just somebody‚Äôs natural face!
@VillaLamp @TheVillaView_ Thank you UAGL, of course forgot about the AFCON. Poor Tshibola, must be more to his story, was a bright talent and now nothing. Maybe my local side @wokingfc should have a look!
@TheVillaView_ Chaps, out of the loop busy Dad here. Just catching up on the US game. What‚Äôs up with Kodjia? Is Tshibola in the first team squad picture? By my reckoning when you can have 25 players, 17 foreigners and U21‚Äôs excluded from the 25, Deano has 3 places to play with?
@AVFCFaithful_ I don‚Äôt get our GK situation. Kalinic: Errors but good at times Nyland: Errors but good at times Steer: Unbeaten run hero. Surely one of them will come good and plant a flag to be #1.
I don‚Äôt believe this. Surely it‚Äôs not even within FA rules or somebody would‚Äôve done it before with a financially stricken club? If it is real I‚Äôm truly appalled and feel great empathy with fans of a great historic club.  #htafc #paddypower

@VillaViews_ I think long term with our wing strength; im talking El Ghazi/Taylor/Hutton/Adomah/Green/Hause we could look at playing a back three. At this stage when we‚Äôve been so shit and finally found a pairing that works with 8 games left, keep that momentum I think.
@VillaViews_ Why would you disrupt a winning CB partnership after all our defensive woes? The full backs are kind of irrelevant, not where our goals come from. Keep them two CH in place, a fool would disturb them.
