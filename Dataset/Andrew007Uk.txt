@Dyspraxialife @BoltonUni Thanks so much. I spoke a lot about #DYSPR and was touched how several people wanted to come and discuss more after due to them having friends or relatives with dyspraxia.

All in all @BoltonUni we're amazing hosts as well as being great partners in my officialwork.

So aside from some exciting discussions on collaborations between @BoltonUni &amp; the Telugu region I got to be part of the first graduation ceremony in my life. Not bad for the boy who‚Äôs primary head gave him a most grim forecast of his future aged 11 Thanks to the many who helped. https://t.co/vmAAtTajEz
When the formal request from @BoltonUni came it turned out to be more than a speech. I was being offered an Hon. Doctorate. I was honoured but not sure I was deserving. All sectret but I sought advice of amazing mentors who all urged me to accept.  Thanks to @PaulTArkwright etc. https://t.co/4cbXH4niSZ
@mjohnsonFCO Thanks my friend
Some months back I was as seen by the Deputy Vice Chancellor of @BoltonUni speak to a group of students in Hyderabad. I always include the challenges of dyslexia and dyspraxia for which was little understood in üá¨üáß in 70s/80s. He asked me to visit and give a motivational speech. https://t.co/YEeGvmdIhu

Always a pleasure to visit Manchester - a dynamic city with a lot of energy but also some superb Victorian architecture. Much has been maintained , at least as a fasade, but some buildings on the outskirts remain vulnerable.

@AlcalasNoseband So pleased to read this (all be it belatedly) - @OfficialWands long overdue a return to their community. They have done incredibly well since having to move the first team to @bromleyfc.
@ForfarAthletic Thanks so much. Living in India I never managed to order it but must arrange a copy sometime. Was a super visit, your Bridies are worthy of another post.
@harris1881 And these days you can get there by train. Still on the bus when I went. Where next?
