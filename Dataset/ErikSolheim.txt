@JohnMarcmail True! But This is still very good news.
The main problem with plastic waste is not CO2 emissions but the direct impact on environment, health and the economy. Plastic waste  among other things is a mortal threat to many animals.
@EdgarHertwich @EricSolheim Co2 emissions remain. But plastic waste is an enormous environment problem, killing many animals for example.
So this is good news! 😁
@KnudJahnke @lillyspickup Please allow me to diagree! This is good news.

@Adjumaweb @tsotsoobilove Yes. That’s one of the potential locations
@freddybobjones Agreed! West Africa is definitely not a country.
Unfortunately I dont have the land based statistics.
@BikeAKL Great video. Thanks!
Is it available on twitter?
@Corbenic @AfrozShah1 Sure! Tsunami here is  a metaphor for a mighty flow. But you are right. It’s all from India.
A lot of plastic waste from around the world is dumped in Southeast Asia. Malaysia 🇲🇾 and other countries are now returning the trash. This is about clean air, clean water, clean earth!

 https://t.co/LwjZFaZzSv
@ErikBerg6 Very happy to! 😁
@lucianosignore Agreed! 👍
@patilshrikant It will produce diesel. But with the enormous benefit of cleaning up the plastic waste at beaches and in neighborhoods.
