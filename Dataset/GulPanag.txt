@vikram_dewan @HardeepSPuri @MoCA_GoI @AAI_Official So you’re basically saying your airline is best ?😎
@neelammathews @DGCAIndia @HardeepSPuri @flyspicejet It’s shorter!! In this weather , with possible impact of aquaplaning - need all the RW length available.
@CaptHena @shukla_tarun @DGCAIndia @flyspicejet @airindiain Even auditors need to be audited 😈.
No free passes when it comes to safety, Captain 👨‍✈️ 😺
Bad weather is something that can be forecasted and planned for, to ensure operations are deferred for at least a few hours. Sometimes that's all that is required. Yes, there will be disruptions &amp; delays but not shutdowns, injury and loss of life. @HardeepSPuri @AAI_Official
In short, the airport director needs to be authorised like a Captain of an aircraft (&amp; made similarly accountable) and shutting down of services should be consultative- but  his/her final call - like a go around our reject is of the Pilot
@HardeepSPuri @MoCA_GoI @AAI_Official
A rethink in the airport decision making process and its chain of command needs to be established that is free of commercial and government pressures when it comes to safety.  @HardeepSPuri @MoCA_GoI  @AAI_Official
A call to shutdown the airport needs to be taken to AVOID accidents not AFTER accidents. This is a process followed in most mature aviation countries in Europe, North America etc. @HardeepSPuri @MoCA_GoI 
We need to start the process of getting there .
While it’s important to examine airline procedures, it’s also critical to hold @AAI_Official . 
There needs to be a regular, assessment from the aerodrome ( AAI/ATC) of the condition of the runway &amp; airport to proactively stop/ suspend operations at the airport in heavy rain/wind
Days after the @flyspicejet  a/c overran the RW in Mumbai, it’s still there- making the primary runway 27 unusable. The secondary, shorter runway is in use. In this rain.  Only recovery equipment- is that of @airindiain - used for Surat recovery. @HardeepSPuri @MoCA_GoI
Bravo @shukla_tarun .  It’s not just about airline safety &amp; procedure audit but audit of AAI &amp; @DGCAIndia too! Days after @flyspicejet a/c excursion at CSIA- it’s STILL there. Only recovery equipment is that of @airindiain - being utilised elsewhere 💁🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/EK3LtovXhg
