Budget 2019: Pan goes, Aadhar remains! Confused govt talks big, makes big promises.Instead of increasing prices of many things it‚Äôs clever to increase cess on diesel/petrol and it has cascading effect on everything. Nothing for farmers. Boring budget
Aurangabad may get good news very soon about air connectivity as just formal announcement is awaited of a new airline starting operations. Get set go Aurangabad. It‚Äôs just the beginning, many more to follow. Efforts paid off.
