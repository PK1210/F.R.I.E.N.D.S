@Marc_Hannaford Oh no harshness was assumed! It's tough but important ground to assess. My strategy, in short-hand journalistic style, is often to say: Someone has done both. I've definitely had, um, firm conversations with editors, in which I insist that we need to cite jazz AND classical work.
@Marc_Hannaford Word, re: the wider issue! One thing with Braxton in particular, though, is that he still *currently* cites and claims multiple genres. Prof. Lewis isn't putting out 7CD Tristano-based sets. Braxton is still doing that, AND writing Trillium, etc.
