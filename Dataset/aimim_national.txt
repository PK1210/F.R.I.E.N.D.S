.@BJP4India has created this monster, and it's killing Muslims and Dalits in India. Today, our country's pluralistic values and democratic principles are under threat.

13. Why @AmitShah and the @BJP4India government are not making a law ion mob lynching? Last year, the Supreme Court had asked the government to make a law on mob lynching. If BJP can make all SC‚Äôs orders into laws, why not this?
12. 145 incidents in 2016-17 &amp; 136 incidents in 2018-19 of deaths in police custody took place. 1797 incidents of deaths in judicial custody took place in 2018-19. There's been no legislative measure, or step taken by  govt to stop such acts and punish the erring police officer
11. There is a growing number of lower-caste men and Muslim men dying in alleged officer-involved gunfights. NHRC says that 179 incidents of encounter killings in 2015-16, 169 in 2016-17 and 155 in 2017-18 took place.
10. The US Freedom Report now has become an annual affair. The US has no right to interfere in the matters of our country and is deliberately putting incidents on minorities in their report. The responsibility now lies more with the Government to control its element.
9. Had we ratified it, we could have amended the Indian
Evidence Act. The police are now the 'holy cow'. No Government will go against the police. The government has to ratify UNCAT.
8. India signed the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT) on October 14, 1997, but it has not ratified it yet despite Justice B. S. Chauhan submitting a report on the implementation through legislation.
7. Paris Principle clearly states that police officers should be independent. Police officers investigating for NHRC are sent on deputation by their forces, while their interests lie with the home cadre. Won't the conflict of interest of the police officer restrict their work?
6. Recommendations of the NHRC should be binding, have judicial or quasi-judicial powers, and power to sit in appeal or review.
5. Human rights courts were supposed to be set up by state governments under Section 30 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. Most of the states have not set up exclusive human rights courts.
4. Selection of members of the NHRC was very opaque and dominated by the ruling party.
3. NHRC should be independent of the government and free from political interference.  However, certain of its deemed members are MPs. If political appointments are made, they should be only in an advisory capacity.
2. Paris Principles require the NHRC to operate independently of government interference. However, Secretary-General and Director of Investigation are seconded by the central government from public services.
1. The whole world knows about the glaring human rights violations that place against minorities, particularly Muslims. A member from the National Commission for Minorities should have included in the selection process.

8. The govt tends to think of fixed tenure and conditions of service as something denoting the 'status' of the office. However, the rationale of such fixed tenure is not 'status' but ensuring the independent functioning of the office.
7. The government made an absurd argument for the amendment; believes that the tenure enjoyed by the Commissioners, being equivalent to the ECI's tenure, is without rationale. Therefore, they should be taken away.
6. Statutory/Constitutionally guaranteed tenures ensure independence and autonomy in functioning. By involving the Executive, the functioning of the independent mechanism comes into doubt.
5. Clauses 2 &amp; 3 is a theft of the Parliament‚Äôs power and its delegation to the executive. Currently, the Parliament can set new conditions for service or tenure. By replacing this power with mere rules and regulations is an insult to the powers of Parliament.
4. By amending the provision, the Union would be usurping the autonomy of states and destroying the federal structure of the legislation.
3. Clause 3 would violate the scheme set out under Article 246. The Union is not competent to legislate on information that is maintained for the subject that falls under the State List.
2. Clause 3 seeks to amend Section 16 of the Act that provides for a statutory fixed tenure and conditions of service. The amendment seeks to abrogate the statutory determined conditions of service and tenure and replace it with service determined by Central government.
1. The RTI (Amendment) Bill, 2019 lacks legislative competence. 

The Constitution demarcates the legislative competence of States and the Union under Article 246. Both the Union and States are competent to legislate on matters contained in the Concurrent List in Schedule VII.

6. Why is the government not appealing the verdict in the Mecca Masjid, Samjhauta, Ajmer blasts cases if it has a firm resolve against terrorism? It seems that the government does not take action when these terrorist attacks are against Muslims and the accused is a non-Muslim.
5. In administrative and constitutional law, we follow the rule that any power is coupled with responsibility. What is the responsibility of the government towards the victim? For eg. Samjhauta Express bombing, the NIA couldn't produce a single CCTV footage of the Delhi station.
4. Section 11, sub-section 1 - Special Courts for such area or areas - is a violation of equality provisions in the Constitution - Article 14.
3. Section 1, sub-section (2) clause (d) of the Act mentions 'affecting the interest of India'. Please define the phrase 'affecting the interests of India'. It will be a new device for the government to book people who criticize and oppose their party and ideology.
2. Section 3 sub-section (2) of the Act gives powers to NIA officers outside India. What is the basis of the powers you are giving to the NIA officers if we do not have the diplomatic clout to carry out investigations in foreign countries?

8. The country is going through a water crisis but @narendramodi ji reduced allocations for National River Conservation Program &amp; Groundwater Monitoring and Regulation by ‚Çπ400 crores and ‚Çπ435 crores respectively.
7. Our police officers face terrible working conditions and work in dilapidated (if not absent) stations. @narendramodi reduced its infrastructure funding by ‚Çπ79 crores. How can you guarantee safety if cops aren‚Äôt well-equipped?
6. @nsitharaman should explain why she reduced the budget for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna - Rural by ‚Çπ552 crores if @narendramodi is serious about achieving the objective of housing for all by 2022.
Compared to 17-18, there has been a cut of ‚Çπ5311 crores. Suprised? We aren't.
5. Umbrella Scheme for SC which includes the post-matric scholarship and the central assistance for welfare schemes for SCs was reduced by ‚Çπ2164 crores. This is proof that @narendramodi‚Äôs 'New India' has no space for educated, independent minorities and Dalits.
4. MGNREGA, the basic safety net for the most vulnerable people, has continued to suffer, seeing a reduction of ‚Çπ1084 crores in its total budget by the @narendramodi government.
3. ‚Çπ20,600.06 crores were collected under the Swachh Bharat cess from '15-'19 but @narendramodi hasn‚Äôt revealed the programs and initiatives the money was spent on. So much for Swachh Bharat!
2. @narendramodi turned Swachh Bharat Mission into a photo-op &amp; advertised its 'success' extensively before &amp; during the polls - but very little was done for the sanitation workers; more than 250 have died since '17. 
If SBA was so successful, why reduce allocations by ‚Çπ4334 cr?
1. @BJP4India and @narendramodi talk about 'empowering minorities with dignity' and 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vishwas', but funds allocated for educational empowerment and pre and post-matric scholarships for Muslims have been reduced by ‚Çπ89 cr and ‚Çπ80 cr respectively.

6. Clause 8 of the Bill decreases the power of the parliament.
Clauses 5, 5 (7), 6, 2 AA, 11, 12, 18 and 23 violates several judgement of the Supreme Court. The Aadhar Bill is unconstitutional and it will be challenged in the SC.
5. The Bill says the relevant entity "shall" identify the clients, which erases the 'voluntariness' the Bill claims to take into account. 
The UIDAI can appoint anyone, notwithstanding conflict of interests. 
Offline verification would lead to fraud.
4. SC had called the dissemination of information to private institutions a vice but the government is keen on making it a virtue.
3.The government is dancing to the tunes of private entities rather than protecting privacy; it's a marriage between state and corporate. It doesn't believe in ‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§®‡•ã ‡§¶‡•ã but only in Jio Jio.
2. The Aadhar Bill shows the ill effects of electoral bonds. Clause 24 violates every fundamental right
1.  SC had said that private entities can't get government data. The Aadhar (Amendment)'s a classic example of 'halala' ‚Äì void

Triple talaq will not benefit the Muslim women as it puts the burden of proof on them. The husband will be three years in jail then who is going to pay for the maintenance? Is the government going to give money for the maintenance? @asadowaisi https://t.co/DkC10Iot1b

5. Through this I would like to ask the government that they have all the love for Muslim women. Why don't they have the same sentiment for Hindu women of Kerala? Why are you against Sabrimala?
4. In this case, the Supreme Court has already said that the marriage is not going to end. We have the Domestic Violence Act, the Muslim Women protection Act 1986. Hence, the bill doesn't satisfy intelligible differentia.
3. The Bill is in violation of Constitution's Articles. The Constitution lays down that if we make a discriminatory law, we will have to satisfy two tests ‚Äî intelligible differentia and rational nexus.
2. The bill will not benefit the Muslim women as it puts the burden of proof on women. The husband will be three years in jail then who is going to pay for the maintenance? Are you going to give money for the maintenance? This is against rational nexus.
1. The classification is not in any way linked to the purported object of the bill. If you see the punishment, then a non-Muslim gets punishment for a year and Muslim would get for three years. This is against Articles 14 and 15.
