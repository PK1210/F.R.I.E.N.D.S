@etimes Kindly clarify. My daughters name is Maryam. Or in it's entirety Maryam Ameerah Salmaan. Amongst the many nicknames we call her Kunju Maryam isn't one of them. Kunju Maryam means Little Maryam. It's a sweet way to refer to small children. But not always their actual names.
Lots of love to Nadirshakka, HariNarayanan, Najim Arshad for such a beautiful track. And lots of love and laughs to @praseesujit master and @Nikhilavimal1 &amp; #PSukumar for making it such a beautiful video ! #KannoNilakayal from #OruYamandanPremaKadha https://t.co/OxjBcyLpvm

And to those wondering, No I wasn't late for my flights nor did I seek special privileges or assistance or cut any queues. I'm neither bratty nor starry. Today I observed this behaviour to a fellow passenger. And previously to my family travelling with an infant @jetairways
Disgusted by @jetairways ground staff attitudes. Multiple airports I've experienced just bad attitude at check in counters and gates. Is it important for your passengers to travel with a bad taste or being insulted ? Talking down to passengers or any human being is plain wrong !
