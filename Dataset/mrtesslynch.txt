@Boys7177929395 @mollylambert @nightcallpod I'm just here to correct everything history got wrong.
@mollylambert @nightcallpod Vilk was something I seriously considered trying to market in 2003. "It's milk that gets you drunk! Because there's vodka in it."
@skinny412 for a while Whole Foods was selling water with floating pieces of fruit and vegetables in it and they'd get all fuzzy after a day of sitting there and were also $8. so why not lemon water! $15.
@busblog CBD without THC definitely makes me drag a little, but usually only for an hour or so. I didn't notice any dopey hangover with the "hoppy water" though (I can't type it without quotes, I feel so embarrassed by this term). Felt pretty peppy the next day!

@monodialogue @tagsavage I had the cushiest mall retail job during college and then a pretty good stint at Wasteland on Melrose but UO was the end of the road
@monodialogue @tagsavage also working retail for like 10 years made me hyper aware of how awful it is when you're working the store 15 minutes before closing and you turn off the music and then it's just the sound of customers making hangers screech on racks
@monodialogue @tagsavage I was there in 2008 and I had pretty much this exact experience. I remember staring across the street longingly at The Gap, thinking they'd never play me that way

One of my kids has a common, asymptomatic genetic mutation that anti-vaxxers claim increases the odds of complications (not backed up by science, obv). What's most dangerous about the anti-v rhetoric, I think, is that it targets parents who are already afraid/vulnerable.
