A very Happy Birthday my beautiful Mumma .. for emotional reasons and biological ones, I wouldn’t be here without you 😜 https://t.co/iPhNOiRQLh
I may not be able to call you everyday but the day’s I’m down I really want you to be around. Can’t thank you enough for the sacrifices you’ve made for me. Moreover THANK YOU FOR JUST BEING YOU .. I’m blessed to call you my mother
Thank you for always letting me believe in superheroes and inspiring me to try and be like one. You made me dream with my eyes open and then gave me the power to go and achieve it.
Someone rightly said, “A mother is she who can take the place of all others but whose place no one else can.” 
You’re the person who’s always given me strength to fight, the courage to face the reality, picked me up when I’ve fallen and then given me the wings to fly.
Special mention to @CastingChhabra for the amazing casting in the film.. the younger actors were amazing
Just finished watching super 30 .. everything about the film speaks of excellence.. inspiring story..  exceptional performances and great direction ..  Go watch it @iHrithik
