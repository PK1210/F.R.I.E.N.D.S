You are attributing more common sense to Pakistani media than is warranted :) https://t.co/sHKne4VUkG
China has asked Pak to distance itself from #Kashmir separatists whose leader Geelani last week harshly criticised China for its treatment of Muslims in #Xinjiang. Pak in a quandary since #Hurriyat separatists are its paid agents to fund &amp; foment terrorism in J&amp;K https://t.co/I8XmfX7tAh

Pakistani judge only dissenter in #ICJ‚Äôs 15-1 decision https://t.co/IJx2Cwer2Q
While Pak can spin #ICJ verdict, #FATF‚Äôs blacklist threat remains its key concern. That‚Äôs why it arrested #HafizSaeed, re-opened air space &amp; is pretending to crack down on terror financing https://t.co/ODqgC0RfUB
#ICJ rules 14-1 in favour of India in #KulbhushanJadhav case, tells Pak to grant consular access &amp; stays death sentence but asks Pak to review case. Pak slammed for violating Jadhav‚Äôs human rights but off the hook since case now back in Pak
Indian media breathes ‚Äúsigh of relief‚Äù, citing fewer flying hours &amp; lower costs after Pak re-opened air space. In matters of national security, convenience &amp; cost should NOT matter. India is a soft state because they seem to. Modi was right to refuse overflying Pak for SCO summit

How did FM @nsitharaman reduce fiscal deficit despite lower tax revenue? By increasing non-tax revenue &amp; upping 2019-20 nominal GDP growth (real+inflation) from 11.5% to 12%. Thus with GDP at Rs 211 lakh crore in 2019-20 and $ at Rs 69, India‚Äôs GDP this year will be $3.1 trillion

@DheerajChitkara More than he does now for sure. Dhoni‚Äôs a speed breaker and even he knows it. In a non-feudal team set-up he‚Äôd have quit 2 years ago
@OldSunil Too little too late. Can‚Äôt wait till the last 2 overs to get going when you‚Äôve been ‚Äúslow boating‚Äù from over number 30. We lost at least 25-30 runs because of non-rotation of strike, etc
@puneetk1976 With due respect, comment after you‚Äôve played against an MCC youth team in England as I‚Äôve done. Till then, zip it.
@colorfulmonk Yes
@colorfulmonk Er, yes :)
@iamAbhiChandel Nope. It‚Äôs your intolerance to others‚Äô views that I‚Äôm calling out. Got it, finally?
@iamAbhiChandel Why on earth not? You from Communist China?
@iamAbhiChandel Censorship much?
@adityatewari13 With due respect, I do. You probably don‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs the feudal system in team India. Pant is a young gun who threatens many egos in the team while Kedar, Shankar &amp; other mediocrities don‚Äôt. https://t.co/jd2gWHBk6c
By slowing down the scoring in the vital middle overs, Dhoni puts pressure on other batsmen to play risky shots like the one that got Virat #CWCUP2019
@kartikaylfc Rahul‚Äôs a sitting duck. Pant at least has shots, doesn‚Äôt play pace like he‚Äôs facing grenades
@mayhoskote Disagree
@ToshitINDIA Agree. See previous tweet
My team &amp; batting order for the semis: Rohit, Pant, Virat, Hardik, Dhoni, Shankar, Jadeja/Jhadav, Bhuvi, Kuldeep, Bumrah, Chahal

First 4 can score quickly, next 3 steadily, there‚Äôre 3+3 pace &amp; spin options (with Hardik &amp; Jadeja/Jhadav the third ops in pace &amp; spin respectively) https://t.co/FIAzRX4of0
Foolish of India not to play Pant in the middle order. Need a leftie who can get the scoreboard moving. Can‚Äôt rely only on Virat. Hope Pant plays against England on Sunday at number 4. He knows English bowling &amp; conditions from last year‚Äôs tour #CWCforIndia
It‚Äôs time to re-examine and re-allocate Lutyens zone bungalows of those who are mere MPs but living in 4-acre homes valued at over Rs 500 crore, costing taxpayers foregone annual outgo of Rs 50 crore. Unjustified. Move them elsewhere and don‚Äôt use security as a catch-all excuse
Dynastic politics is an infectious disease. Virus seeded in 1959 with Indira Gandhi appointed @INCIndia president by Nehru when she was 42. Other parties have caught the virus and so apparently has BJP. Bad augury for it if it‚Äôs allowed to continue https://t.co/DZHwRjAj9v
@vivek2456 Why don‚Äôt you personally escort them to Pakistan where doubtless they‚Äôll feel at home
@NRK1979 Obviously. I‚Äôm making a broad comparison between human rights, slavery and racism that resulted in segregation till the 1960s, giving US zero rights to lecture others on any aspect of freedom. Clear now?
BJP MLA #AkashVijayvargiya beats civic officials with a cricket bat, showing how quickly power goes to politicians‚Äô heads. BJP leaders should let the law take its course. Arrested MLA needs to receive exemplary punishment  https://t.co/wKQuQ5NEiX
Trump‚Äôs policy on Central American migrants is a case of human rights abuse. Children as young as 2 are separated from their parents &amp; held in dirty, crowded detention centres. And America, with its slave-owning past, lectures others on religious freedom? https://t.co/spKc60mM8T
#Reupping my oped on how #Brexit, esp if @BorisJohnson wins the prime ministership on July 23, could lead to Scotland seceding from the UK, reducing England to its pre-colonial status https://t.co/8CTdyySH3h
