"MS Dhoni absorbs all the pressure. This is where his experience comes in handy for the team. We all saw how he took the game deep &amp; in the end, it was because of him that we could reach 268 which was very good total on this wicket"

@imVkohli on MS Dhoni 💙😊

"He's one guy who sends out a message that what the par score is on a pitch. If he says 265 is a good score on a pitch, we don't aim for 300 and end up scoring 230. He is a legend for us, and hopefully he'll continue."
