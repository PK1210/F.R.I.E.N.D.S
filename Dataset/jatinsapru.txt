A little detox from cricket! #ThatCricketGuy turns  #DadCricketGuy for a few weeks .. https://t.co/80zuKnAKxT
RT @RK_sports: Talk about having fun unlimited! That’s exactly what Googlies 2.0 was all about. Awesome to be in the company of @Priyadarsh…
Not sure where I stand on number of boundaries deciding a Final’s fate... But fair to say England won by the brand of cricket they set out to play. Yet to recover from yesterday. But every thought comes with a reminder of how cruel the day was to NZ .. #CWC19Final #ENGvNZ
Hahah.. And they get exactly 15 in this one .... WHAT A MATCH #EngvNz
Can’t watch this anymore .... BEFITTING FINAL #ICCWC2019
Blessed. We’re blessed to witness these two champions going at each other and greatness, slam after slam .. year after year... To many more #Fedal s 🥂 https://t.co/PP3cFzRoZA
Sorry Rafa... clay belongs to you but the grass is greener on Federer’s side .. G.O.A.T #KingFed #Fedal
So the #CWC19 will see a ‘new’ world champion. A New England vs New Zealand ... All that hard work in changing the limited overs set up has paid dividends for the hosts. Lord’s awaits a new chapter #EngvNZ

Fantastic five for Shami but standing ovation for Bumrah .. 1/44 in a 337 run innings. Five overs on the trot at death. Number 1 for a good darn reason.. The real boom boom #IndvEng
Jadejaaaaaaaa ... #IndvEng
Player of the tournament in 2015 - Bowler of the tournament so far.. Iron man Mitch Starc is pure class .. Australia and world cups, the romance continues (so far).. #AUSvNZ
Feel for Afghanistan ... This could’ve been a memorable win ..  But they’ve got only themselves to blame for letting it slip away. Congratulations Pakistan. Trust their fans would be supporting India tomorrow 😉 #PAkvAFG

@tushar_shahi092 The zombie in black?? Yep, was me
Shami and Bumrah toil so hard during the net sessions. Hardly any difference in approach or intensity.. Unbelievable execution under pressure... Fantastic win this .. #IndvAfg
@MayankK18425115 @KP24 England are a champion side still. It’s not any comparison .. two favourite teams are still likely to fight for the title

Well played @BCBtigers .. This team has definitely inched ahead of Pakistan and Sri Lanka ... Dynamics of cricket in the subcontinent have clearly changed.. second strongest Asian side ? #CWC19 #WIvBAN
2003 - Saw his centurion blitz at a small xerox shop while bunking tuition before a physics exam. 2019 - Called Rohit Sharma’s xerox copy of that same shot alongside him in the commentary box. Never say never .. #IndvPak #CWC19 @sachin_rt https://t.co/ak4L2G2jTc
