@Andrew_Legge @JoseMolinaTV @Montagsdayjob What I was considering is that perhaps there is a missing piece. Drafts don't always hit the mark &amp; with some time passing, authors often recognize where they have missed the mark. Perhaps sometimes we direction on how to focus our notes.
@arashamel No, not at all. I have rarely replaced writers on the films that I have been part of. When that occurs it mostly has to do with the director who comes aboard at a later state.
@JoseMolinaTV @Montagsdayjob And with all due respect too, those that deliver a script to me, I honestly believe, believe that our collaboration will lift the work higher.  Good luck with yours, but I have found that most work needs more than just luck — or the originating author.

I am surprised by how rare it is for a writer, producer, or director to come into a script meeting and tell me what they want to do. Instead they want the studio to give the notes. Seems backwards to me. If they did speak first &amp; declare, the conversation would be better.

@MBFilmmaker Utah &amp; Iowa have lowest  income inequality in USA and supposedly the highest levels of happiness. Maybe they are connected?
@MBFilmmaker Totally get that but most film festivals barely survive financially too. How to balance?
@OphHarry That’s the question of the meaning of life isn’t it? The fact that there is no easy answer is what defines us individually.
@mimbale I think that is something that @sundanceorg @filmindependent @ifpfilm and other orgs, as well as film schools, festivals &amp; entities like @FilmmakerMag can help with
It is an exciting time to be making movies when cultural relevance seems to be as great a driver for recognition, appreciation, &amp; overall success as anything else.
project pitching&amp;submission feels so transactional from the start. It demeans the work that will come from that 1st meeting. How can we lift a project up, shine a light on the ambition &amp; aspiration initially &amp; then carry it forward throughout?
Change process, change result.
