@mattmpix @QLDmaroons Nah he’s a blue ! Useless but blue nonetheless !
@plalor @thechappellfndn @imVkohli Great stuff everyone
I’m a broncs fan but how do the refs / bunker and admin , cop that last forward pass plus the dummy half ones ??
@stevebarrett88 @Davidjohn71 @FoxCricket @Uz_Khawaja No way unless it was a graphic error .I do think I left Stoinis out accidentally though ! He’s in
@Davidjohn71 @FoxCricket @Uz_Khawaja Not really especially in their respective form but it’s Warner who took Uzzy’s spot and Finch is my  capt . If he doesn’t play well in UAE, maybe Maxwell capt and UK back in ???
@malcolmconn A lot@of people would have thought that Connie !!
@FoxCricket Magnificent
@plalor They all do it Pete , every bloody party
@PetefromHayNSW @malcolmconn @CricketNSWBlues @CricketAus @chrissmithradio You’ve been clear that’s for sure Pete !
Great indigenous round idea initiated by Dan Christian @Renegades@bbl each franchise will be able to host thousands of guests brought in from all parts , as recognition
@malcolmconn @CricketNSWBlues Brilliant Kurtis , exactly what we need . Sustained performance
@Robertw24247177 Got there in style !!!! My niece
@7Cricket @philtufnell Just intimating that I never said anything Tuffers !!
@7Cricket @philtufnell All good buddy , have you cracked out Teddy yet ?
@7Cricket @philtufnell Did not Tuffers !!!!
@RicFinlay Rubbish Ricster ! Replay the match
@ProfDeano Bullshit Deano
@ElizabethHurley Hi Liz !
@plalor Doesn’t matter either Pete . He has the physical side of his job covered , that’s the 4th or 5th most important facet of cricket in case anyone wants to listen
@KP24 Top call KP .
@acljames @TimmyGreaney Leave them out of this please !!
@acljames Good call , I only just remembered it had become full time . Invers and Rod were the first .
@rodneyheron Is that what it is up to Info ? I did remember the Chairman became well paid when John Inverarity started , wasn’t sure what. Used to be voluntary .
@DeLuca_JD It used to be voluntary , with travel allowances , but I just remembered it become a proper job when John Inverarity began , then Rod Marsh . So it is ok these days for the Chairman I think
Actually from John Inverarity’s introduction onwards , I think the money has been ok .
@ProfDeano Yeah mate , all ok .
@ShaneWarne Performance culture has been non existent since professionalism Joon
@ProfDeano Let them breathe for another week or two Deano . The home chaos could deservedly last a while !!!!
I really like the idea of George Bailey or such a player becoming a national selector . Will they do it for the pittance on offer or will they devote appropriate time if the pay improves ?
@ProfDeano And Sheffield Shield . State selectors could value club more than ever too and have state cricket players play and perform at every opp .
@reliableritesh @BrettLee_58 Hard work and hunger will allow them to get some confidence Ritesh . Let’s get serious !!
@Clarry05838907 @Foxtel @RoySymonds63 Sorry Clarry
@ourswich @RoySymonds63 @meljones_33 @FoxCricket Mmmmmn good call

@bhughesgolf @ProfDeano Always good Lrif roomie !!
@SteveCrawleyFox His admission of excessive aggression ,was a mistake that he’s learnt from ,was great to listen to in the short version shown at lunch today .
@WIR_DB I think that was the first of three in the space of two overs!!!

@tommyhuf @meljones_33 Have just seen this - fantastic
@craddock_cmail Taufel and Kettleborough have a lot to answer for . Umpires doing photoshoots !! Ploise
How much kerfuffle at the Broncs !!! Maybe it’s gone too far now but how lucky , to be able to appoint Benny to the Director of footy (1 yr earlier than he wanted) and Kevvie to coach !!!! Are they making it too hard ?
When Stan says he left a bit out there in his first career , it certainly wasn’t passion or entertainment . It was great to have him in our rooms . #Bummer  https://t.co/SQO4ZB170h
