@melvillmatic @zinoman But to @zinoman's point, I would agree we don't consider enough what acting is, or apply any rigor to how we describe it. Too often we say it's great, or bad, and expect others to agree or know what the hell we're talking about.
@melvillmatic @zinoman I'm not interested in calling out bad acting or reading about it. It's like calling a film boring - it's entirely subjective and says nothing about what is happening before us. Instead tell me what the performance is doing, how it does or doesn't fit what's surrounding it.
@melvillmatic @zinoman We're completely unprepared for evaluating this with any skill or nuance, on the main. Too few critics come to criticism via performance, whereas we feel more confident about visuals, music, narrative.

@julietlapidos @zinoman @mattzollerseitz @MarkHarrisNYC @bendwilliams @swholdren I know it's not what you mean, but legal briefs and the language therein have been a key component of work by Boggs, Magid, Ledare, etc. Totally fine with an artist making such claims, just means a different angle of scrutiny.
@zinoman It was a provocation. I'm happy to be considered insane in order to forward the notion.
@zinoman Different forms and writers have different ratios and overlaps. Saying Didion belongs in one room and not another, or documentaries similarly, denies commonality and diminishes thornier qualities. I don‚Äôt see it as threatening or diminishing in either direction.
@zinoman It‚Äôs a point of view. And it‚Äôs a tweet feebly encapsulating things I‚Äôve been writing about for years. I see more reason to recognize overlap between these terms and disciplines than claim hard distinctions.
@mattzollerseitz @julietlapidos @zinoman @MarkHarrisNYC @bendwilliams @swholdren Me neither
@zinoman @mattzollerseitz @MarkHarrisNYC @bendwilliams @swholdren I think it's morally irresponsible for journalists to NOT consider their work art. It's still reporting, it's still factual, but you're making artistic choices, shaping stories, every step of the way. You're making art with and from reality, and being mindful of this is essential

@jessicakiang @melvillmatic @MarkHarrisNYC HARD disagree.
@jessicakiang @melvillmatic @MarkHarrisNYC But doesn't it depend on what's being critiqued and how? You're ruffling my feathers with this "merit" word! I think art is a much bigger category, one that can encompass both ends of the exchange, and therefore can contain a wild variance of quality and qualities.
@brofromanother Get us a room!
@jessicakiang @melvillmatic @MarkHarrisNYC I love humility! More humility before the work, please. But I also like humble art. And I don't seem much difference between criticism needing art to exist and art needing life or subjective experience in order to exist. There's a transformation either way.
@melvillmatic @MarkHarrisNYC I've always enjoyed (within limits, of course) the Oscar Wilde approach, which is basically asserting that art exists for criticism to make better art.
@brofromanother I feel seen, thanks.
@melvillmatic @MarkHarrisNYC You think art is more rarified than criticism? I actually think it's often the other way around. Shouldn't it all be less exclusive, rather than drawing hard lines between the two?
@MarkHarrisNYC @melvillmatic It shouldn't need to be art to be worth defending, and there is a wide spectrum of criticism with different motives and qualities, but the criticism I care about isn't merely functional, it creates its own artistic space, working from the same materials and tools as fiction etc.
