@amitupadhyaya @devarsighosh Have you seen Night Moves? There's a line in that movie which you would concur with:)
@aiyyaar @devarsighosh I like that scene but I see where you're coming from. It's definitely a Dilip Kumar being Dilip Kumar for the galleries moment, more than a genuinely in-character moment.
@aiyyaar @devarsighosh Haha! Also, it's "Cool-karni," not Kulkarni:)

@GChintamani @mileeashwarya @PenguinIndia Great point about Sahni. On a slightly different note, shall we make a thread on the actors about whom we'd like to read about and why:)
@elitecynic @shividungarpur Yes, Spielberg has mentioned it too.
Don't think there has been an homage to 80s young adult fiction as widely adored as Stranger Things. The extent of which can be seen in the new trailer for #ITChapter2, where some parts almost play like a nod to Stranger Things, a show which is actually a big nod to Stephen King.
@shividungarpur Shivendra, any idea about the date on this one?
@Bollywoodirect Naseer?

@ravikantbhat These old theaters should have heritage status. It‚Äôs sad that they can be legally demolished to build new structures in their place.
@ravikantbhat Parts of Ani... Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar were shot there, I believe. I remember Abhijeet Deshpande mentioning on the podcast that they shot at theatres in Miraj and Sangli because they have still maintained their vintage feel.

Bal Gandharva, a doyen of early Indian theatre, essayed female characters during 1910s and 1920s, at a time when Indian women did not have the agency to act on stage. He imbibed "feminine" grace and gait --- typifying gender fluidity, long before its coinage. #SareeTwitter https://t.co/iEvatVd1Ie

Imagine a Govinda-Santoshi collab.
@hims_negi @aiyyaar Yes, I wish we saw more of Govinda-Bhatt
@hims_negi @aiyyaar Good question. Don‚Äôt know. Personally, I think most old films are going to fall short when you try to check if they hold up, but that‚Äôs fine because you have to judge them, keeping in mind the times when those films were made. BTW, I like Awaargi.

Shotgun is Jimmy Malone and Amrish Puri is Al Capone, in case you are wondering. Check it out; it's on Youtube. The stairway shootout/Odessa steps sequence is pretty underwhelming though. Just heads up.
JURRAT (1989), heavily borrowed from De Palma's The Untouchables, has some interesting styling.

Even Trimurti which often gets knocked on, had its moments. Anil Kapoor's introductory scene, for example, packs in a hell of a punch. Mukul Anand does justice to AK's swag and AK returns the favor by carrying, smashingly, Mukul Anand's stylistic flourishes.
