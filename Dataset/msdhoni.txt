1st event over,time to eat something and report back for UB shoot in 20 mins,tht came as a surprise the event lasted more than10 mins
Our match jersey is the same with a few diff sponsors,practice 1 has more blue in it compared to yellow which is looking good
But a fact about jersey unveiling event is tht u take more time to get ready and spend less time on stage.
IPL briefings,team meetings,meet and greet and also shoots for new sponsors,practice,travel and in between try to understand the new players
1st day of CSK it's about to start with jersey unveiling .till the 1st week of IPL gets over it will b very busy for the players
Fantastic game,with 10men it was always difficult for RM.anyways time to sleep now
2nd half is where the big players show their skill and fitness,even more interesting half awaits us
Bale and Ronaldo's pace will be a big threat for barca
I just love Messi,let's c who gets a card now
Top stuff Real Madrid
One each, that's wat I was talking about
Barcelona draws first blood that makes it even more interesting RM also playing well
Doesn't matter which team wins,I am here for entertainment
Barcelona all the way for Messi, May the best team win
Real Madrid vs Barcelona, entertaining 105 mins ahead
