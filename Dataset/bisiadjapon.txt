Dems need to stop this in-fighting. It’s counterproductive. @SpeakerPelosi defended the squad. @AOC and co, please stop publicly bashing your colleagues and try to find a common ground. I am disappointed . Yesterday can’t be undone. Let’s look forward and not hold grudges

@BlueBirdTail You are not only a prolific writer but an open and generous soul. I’m not on Twitter but just read your series. I ‘m struck by the sheer poetry of your prose.
@washingtonpost How about a different headline: Halep wins get second grand slam while Serena remains at 23. She has achieved what no woman in the open era has. Halep played a brilliant game. More positive
How women’s bodies are policed, especially black women. Her curves offended @AmericanAir (American Airlines). Just because you wouldn’t wear that is no excuse to shame her. Very upsetting https://t.co/P8Z2qfLOsw

Parents, create a safe atmosphere for your children so they can come talk to you about sex or anything that subject that piques them. Don’t hit girls or pepper them when they are curious #WomensProgress
Mothers, let your daughters know having their period is a source of life and pride. Don’t take it as an opportunity to groom them solely to serve men. Don’t force feed them, don’t make them swallow an egg, don’t parade them bare/breasted to snag men #womenrule
