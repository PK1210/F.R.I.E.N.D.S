So pleased to have Barbara Hammer Superfan @helenafleabody on Barbara Hammer, Superdyke, an essential screening series starting starting today @MovingImageNYC 

https://t.co/RNHqdubemz https://t.co/phzpCCKxjH
@TyleKurner Literally the same thing happened to me over a decade ago. I made the wrong decision. Won't say which, but you can guess.
I've long been wanting to talk about the queer appeal of Brian De Palma. Finally had the chance to at least start to do so with the undeniable, unbelievable FEMME FATALE:  https://t.co/U787bmabdD https://t.co/gkbIxf7bwR
...and, you knew it was coming, Simran Hans—@heavier_things—on Binoche's sojourn in American rom-com territory, DAN IN REAL LIFE: https://t.co/R9V12QEblM https://t.co/sbMEAgndXL
...Chloe Lizotte—@celizotte—on the elusive ephemerality of Binoche's role in Assayas's great SUMMER HOURS: https://t.co/XlYONZIoQu https://t.co/UvamuPaYl4
"Binoche Auteur" continues with a delightful trio of essays, starting with Julien Allen—@JulesArk—on Binoche's gobsmacking starring debut, RENDEZ-VOUS, directed by André Téchiné and written by Olivier Assayas:   https://t.co/t8ZWqTSIi6 https://t.co/uZzESyMjMi

...and @NicksFlickPicks on Binoche, the body, and the gaze in Małgorzata Szumowska's ELLES: https://t.co/yXYF6zfr9g https://t.co/OsN42SZydS
...then read @emmapiperburket on Bruno Dumont's CAMILLE CLAUDEL 1915 and Binoche's reversal of the artist-muse relationship: https://t.co/aCfp6E9SnF https://t.co/kexcNWKb0N
It's Monday, so that means a new crop of essays in our Binoche Auteur symposium. Today, three Binoche portraits in close-up. First up, Nadine Zylberberg on the tricks and treats of Abbas Kiarostami's CERTIFIED COPY:  https://t.co/G7jqnwhAP1 https://t.co/2Q5Y7D9W9F
Inherited a treasure trove of original sheet music from a great aunt. I’ve gasped approximately 33 times and there are hundreds more to sort through. https://t.co/2LhfSHlj4C
For this week's column, the great Kate Hepburn at her most wonderfully androgynous. I love SYLVIA SCARLETT: https://t.co/UOQD7FHBit
In case you weren't there for all the fun, now's your chance to get caught up. This was a delight, and so thankful to be joined by hilarious and eloquent fellow queers @MelissEAnderson, @Wesley_Morris, @MarkHarrisNYC, and @brandnewfarihah: https://t.co/NVqrnFLBHZ
@bnwlfsnNYT always feel free to DM
Yes! Let’s all acknowledge Shonni Enelow, one of the very very best writers out there. https://t.co/FlF4FuwXtU
...and a penetrating deep dive from @Ela_Bittencourt about sex, control, and Binoche's puzzling Dr. Dibs in Claire Denis's singular HIGH LIFE: https://t.co/Qsnp3fGtbw
So much more to come... https://t.co/U4pFvL2JCf
Chris Wisniewski on Binoche's presence and absence in Hou Hsiao-hsien's masterpiece FLIGHT OF THE RED BALLOON: https://t.co/Z0Mcj8W6qh https://t.co/d6dy2WvsUv
First three essays this week include: @shonnienelow unpacking issues of gender, race, and performance in that subway scene—you know the one—in Haneke's CODE UNKNOWN: https://t.co/xHzNVsh5Tc https://t.co/yr4kIAuURp
It's July and we're letting the sunshine in. Delighted to introduce our new Reverse Shot summer symposium, Binoche Auteur, a deep dive into the career of mercurial and magnificent Juliette Binoche. Read our intro: https://t.co/rDuSf68mAW https://t.co/5Vi5idjfkR
@zackneuman together they comprise one of the most amazing debut films of all time. The first of the three I wrote about here: https://t.co/TbtYv58kFw and all of them in here: https://t.co/aYeGFyWHzu
@zackneuman The unforgettable Terence Davies Trilogy, of course
Little Bud looking longingly at the mystical movie screen in THE LONG DAY CLOSES is a sweet image, but here are some of my personal favorite Terence Davies images, just in time for, uh, "Pride": https://t.co/jdOfJ5CGmC

@vidali2 @JeffReichert9 @cgduckworth @tylrmntg @brofromanother @celizotte @JulesArk @JordanCronk @Bedatri @devikagirgayi Soon...soon
Presenting our full list of the Best of 2018, with original writing from @JeffReichert9, @cgduckworth, @tylrmntg, @brofromanother, @celizotte, @JulesArk, @JordanCronk, @Bedatri, and @devikagirgayi 
https://t.co/QgOaxASX9Z
1. ZAMA—by a landslide. Lucrecia Martel's "great comedy of effete, ineffectual middle management" and "somehow her most elliptical and approachable work to date" (@JeffReichert9) #Bestof2018
2. LET THE SUNSHINE IN. "a wincing but sensitive portrait of a woman rushing headlong into self-made follies . . . Binoche’s eyes burnish each frame with their fanatic gleam." (@cgduckworth) #Bestof2018
3. IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK by Barry Jenkins. "The more things change the more they stay the same. The film's brilliance is in illustrating this without using heavy-handed dialogue or portrayals of trauma to make the point." (@tylrmntg) #Bestof2018
4. BURNING, a "discomfiting, richly confounding take on the thriller." Lee Chang-dong's protagonist "proves himself as incapable of defining his moral boundaries as the film itself is unwilling to share its own themes with the audience." #Bestof2018
5. HAPPY AS LAZZARO. Alice Rohrwacher "engages our empathy, both for her picaro-style protagonist and for a labor class whose disadvantage transcends both the march of time and the advent of heavy industry." (@brofromanother)  #Bestof2018
6. FIRST REFORMED. "Paul Schrader envisions a crisis of faith as an answerless, nondenominational fight for the will—the right—to continue living in a society that has sealed its own destruction." (@celizotte) #Bestof2018
7. THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS, the Coen Brothers' "ravishing, noble, and poignant chronicle of utter turpitude and degradation . . . conflates beauty and misery in a way that reflects the blessed paradox of the genre’s terrifying appeal." (@JulesArk) #Bestof2018
8. WESTERN by Valeska Grisebach. Her first film in over a decade is "a meditation on masculinity, an allegorical spin on entrenched xenophobia, and an exemplary piece of genre cinema" (@JordanCronk)  #Bestof2018
9. ROMA, Alfonso Cuarón's "masterful spectacle" of those "whose quiet labor often doesn’t make the cut in the grand narrative of 'work' portrayed onscreen." (@Bedatri)  #Bestof2018
Our #Bestof2018 countdown begins. 10: HALE COUNTY THIS MORNING, THIS EVENING. RaMell Ross "anchors us to the granular beauty of each moment" and "upends the colonialist impulse of visual ethnography" (@devikagirgayi) https://t.co/0wOEa7fyux
@brofromanother If there were ever a consensus pick...
Grab a whiskey glass of Pepto Bismol and prepare yourself for the Reverse Shot year-end extravaganza to begin today at 11 a.m. EST with our top ten of 2018. https://t.co/Dbh67YCoqm
@bmrow "hotness" is too meager a word for this
@charles_kinbote Thank you, and GREAT movie, but SORRY for those shitty f-ing character glitches. Each one is a dagger to the heart.
Ringing in the New Year with one of the kinkiest studio releases ever. Queer &amp; Now &amp; Then continues into 2019! https://t.co/txDWj6lMi5
RT @FilmComment: We talk about the movies that didn't crack our top 20 of 2018. Listen to @NicolasRapold, Michael Koresky, @maddiewhittle &amp;…
On that same note we’re waiting for your return, @senatormayukh
New Years resolution to avoid auto fill fails. We also need to point out the dauntingly smart @zenonthesequal and @msicism and @littleglissant and @elusivecorporal and @vrizov and all those folks who wisely stay off Twitter. Phew have to lie down.
And to the genius programmers and erstwhile critics @_Ash_Clark and @_subarashii. Come back, big shots.
And what would we do without the brilliance of @shonnienelow and Imogen Sara Smith and @JordanCronk and @AzadehJafari and, if only once, @melvillmatic ?
The wonderful @celizotte and @Maximinalist and @therealmarkasch and @unbuttonmyeyes @keithuhlich @FernandoFCroce.   This is what happens when you tweet from a karaoke room with no cell service
