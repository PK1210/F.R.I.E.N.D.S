@ZalimCapitalist @jaya_misra From what I understand... the lady has done a commendable job of tracing the chain but is essentially thrown off by the way this note has been framed. At no point has any comparative statistic been able to deny that India‚Äôs water crisis is real and that we will be dry in a decade
@ZalimCapitalist @jaya_misra It‚Äôs meant to alarm &amp; alert citizens because water is not endless. Have you seen 2019 monsoon reports yet? . What you‚Äôre doing is putting  people back in the same lull of unpanicked, callous water wastage... I‚Äôm shocked at the purpose of your tweet. 2/2
@ZalimCapitalist @jaya_misra I‚Äôm sorry but you are wrong. This is not a false statistic. It‚Äôs based on a UN report that assessed all potential water reservoirs including lakes and water boddies, ground water, deforestation that‚Äôs leading to an imbalanced water cycles and rains. 1/2
