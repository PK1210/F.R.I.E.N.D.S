@jaivas22 @FirstpostSports @firstpost Richardson was injured. Turner was unable to bowl, so was overlooked.
Minimal runs to play with and a benign surface, but until Lyon develops a plan B in white ball cricket it is difficult to see him excelling. In saying that, he has had a great world cup on pitches that have been dry #AUSvENG
The English fans absolutely giving it to Mitch Starc down at fine leg. #AUSvENG
@jigsactin Email or whatsapp me
Roy unrattled by the occasion. Playing his natural game and putting the pressure back on Australia. Excellent start from England, the crowd also starting to get vocal #AUSvENG
Starc and Behrendorff swinging the ball as they warm-up on the practice pitches. How long will it swing and can England handle it ? #AUSvENG
Leg spinners haven't prospered as much as many expected at the #CWC19, but that is wonderful spell by Adil Rashid. Wickets in the middle overs are just priceless #AUSvENG
Presence of Maxwell leads to Rashid dropping one half way down the track, his first bad ball of the day. Maxwell moves to 20, he needs to keep batting on instinct. #AUSvENG
Top bowling from Rashid. He has hardly bowled a bad ball. Bit of reward for consistency. #AUSvENG
England have really done their homework on Carey. Nothing remotely short and with width outside off-stump. He is master at pulling those balls through the leg side #AUSvENG
Might be time for Adil Rashid. Don't want to delay introducing him, Australia just stating to push the tempo #AUSvENG
@KyleJL7 Eng v Aus at Lord's ? Pak v Ind ? Pak v Aus ? Just three examples of pitch that have aided some seam early and bowlers failed to pitch it up.
Teams finally pitching the ball up. NZ did it yesterday and  England today. Got to make the batsmen come forward, lovely stuff from the English bowlers. #AUSvENG
Thanks Karthik. A touch of seam and he has been exposed. https://t.co/Ql6864gjk8
Massive day for England. They have revolutionsed ODI cricket with there approach, but can the batsmen deliver in a semi final run chase. #AUSvENG
End of an era..#dhoni #INDvNZ
Big test for Matt Henry, the last time he bowled in such scenario, WI smashed him for 20+ #INDvNZ
RT @anandvasu: Broadcast should shut off the commentary and just beam what Dhoni is telling Jadeja mid-pitch. #CWC19 #INDvNZ
Neesham will still need to bowl one more over as will Matt Henry. India will target those two overs #INDvsNZ
India have scored 9 of the last three overs without minimal risks. This is the brilliance of Jadeja and calculative mind of Dhoni. #INDvsNZ
Jadeja accelerating at the right moment.  This is a big ground and India will run a lot of two's.  Are NZ starting to panic? If they do - Dhoni can pull this off, regardless of his form, he is still a master at telling Jadeja which bowlers to target #INDvsNZ
Pant handling the movement and pressure beautifully. His next challenge will be the short balls from Ferguson. #INDvNZ
Pitch the ball up and most teams will struggle.  Well done to the NZ quicks and its something other teams should have done more often at #CWC19
Can the New Zealand bowlers make Rohit Sharma drive early on? Teams have been reluctant to pitch the ball full to him early on. He has rarely played a cover drive in the first 10 overs. #INDvNZ
Chaos in Manchester last night as fans and journalists had to rearrange bookings. No such panic on #wcuponwheels #INDvNZ https://t.co/z2aqXBA22Z
Play called off. Match will continue tomorrow. Tickets for today will be valid for tomorrow #INDvNZ
Raining again..... https://t.co/vvg1UIX5oo
Covers are off and there will be an inspection in 20mins #INDvNZ
The sun is out at Old Trafford, but still a bit of drizzle around #INDvNZ
Hardik Pandya back on the field. But he continues to clutch at his groin. and move gingerly.  #INDvNZ
Crucial innings for Ross Taylor. He can be slow starter and that can lead to NZ stagnating though the middle overs.  Just needs to ensure he doesn't put pressure on Williamson #INDvNZ
Hardik Pandya going off the field #INDvNZ
Williamson still find the gap....such beautiful use of the hands. Just meets the ball at the right time #INDvNZ
There was a long conference between Hardik, Kohli and Rohit after Pandya's last over. It has resulted in two men behind square on the off-side and a 3rd man for Williamson.  Clear plan is to keep it on a good length outside off and stop runs down down to 3rd man #INDvNZ
Kohli in the gully, an important position for Williamson. He punches a lot of balls off the back foot and is prone to hitting one upplishly. Also it blocks his dab to third man. #INDvNZ
@MitchellGlenn Purists aside Glenn, it was the skill of the caller to identify a player based on their appearance, build, mannerism or even the way they walk or run. With numbering it makes it a lot easier
SAF are out of the #CWC19 but they have made certainly made Australia's job a lot tougher. India are on the 'easy' side of the draw. #INDvSL
What a knock by Alex Carey. For those unaware of his background this story by @beastieboy07 is a must read # ausvsa

https://t.co/WJ7XDHXBgg
Aaron Finch was struggling with the incoming ball. So how did it rectify the problem ? Here is my take on it #INDvSL #CWC19 #AUSvSA https://t.co/dIW9Oqb9jh
Is that the first flick through mid wicket for Rohit Sharma at #CWC19 ? He has been reluctant to play that shot, but this just shows what good form he is in #INDvSL

My take on why Dhoni doesn't connect with the big shots as consistently as before #ENGvNZ #CWC19 #dhoni https://t.co/TVoUTdVHOS
Not sure about all the fuss about Dhoni's retirement wasn't it obvious he will quit after the #CWC19 ? #ENGvNZ #dhoni
Hardik Pandya has been exceptional with the ball today and also in the later stages of England. So much focus on his batting, but his ability to judge a pitch and adjust accordingly is vastly improving with each outing. #INDvBAN
Couple of days ago, the Indian seamers bowlers a lot of cutters by using their wrists. Today they have mixed it up by delivering with a cross seam. #IndvBang
Indian fielders hurling the throws into the dry portions of the square. They must believe the ball will reverse on this used pitch in the latter stages of the game. #IndvBang
Bangladesh trying to dismiss Pant in the same manner as England.  Bowling at his hip and hoping he scoops his flick to deep backward square. #INDvBAN
For the first time today, Bangladesh get it spot on. Push the ball across Hardik and employ a slip. Good bowling and smart tactics. #INDvsBAN
Adil Rashid warming up at point. Remember he dismissed Pandya here during the Test match last year when he was trying to win the game with No.10 and 11. #ENGvIND
Worth observing how well Hardik Pandya holds his shape when he lofts the ball. It is just beautiful to watch. #ENGvIND
Effortless batting by Rohit Sharma.  Minimal risk but maximum output. Both of these batsmen showing the world how to orchestrate a chance. #INDvENG
This is really good captaincy by Kohli, he has brought the fielders in the inner ring really close to stop the easy singles. England are stalling slightly, they need to keep attacking. #ENGvsIND
Finally, England are playing the brand of cricket we all expected.  To be fair, the inclement weather has not enabled the groundsmen to prepare such placid tracks. #ENGvIND
KL Rahul going off the field clutching at his hip #INDvENG
England finally seem to have a pitch that will suit there batsmen. Bairstow and Roy going really hard at the ball. Surprisingly, no bouncer from the Indian fast bowlers as yet #ENGvIND #INDvENG
A touch of reverse swing and Starc is unplayable.....#AUSvNZ
Steve Smith warming up in the covers. We might see the former skipper bowl a few leg spinners #AUSvNZ
Finch turns to Lyon and decides to park himself under the lid at short-leg. How many captains in world cricket would do that? Importantly, it is such a vital catching position for Lyon #AUSvNZ
Alex Carey proving why he is such a versatile cricketer. Such a simple uncomplicated technique. Importantly, he is master at dispatching the bad ball to boundary. #AusvNZ
@PatrickM_Gray He is lethal during the back end and bowls a few economical overs.  He is an ideal No.7 and Langer was getting the best out of him at that spot. He can be the floater when Australia has a solid platform.
Horrible shot by Maxwell. Still to the belief he shouldn't be batting before the 35th or 40th over. #AUSvNZ
Hope Glen Maxwell proves me wrong, but don't understand why Alex Carey doesn't bat at No.5 when Australia lose early wickets.  #AUSvNZ
The crowd is certainly more vocal during the early stages of the #AUSvsNZ match than they were for the #EngvAus game.

Such precise lengths by the Aussie quicks. Pitch it up and give it time to swing. The ball is swinging for the first time into he tournament for Starc and Behrendorff. #CWC19 #ENGvAUS
Credit to the Australian for opting to open with Behrendorff. He is at his best with the new ball. #CWC19 #ENGvAUS
The pitch seems to be doing a lot more after the five overs. Perhaps its the affect of the roller that is wearing off.  #AUSvENG

There you go, beautiful bowling by Kuldeep to get rid of Babar Azam https://t.co/v5bmVZFquj
Kuldeep has been impeccable with his length today.  He is making the batsmen play off the front foot. This pitch has some turn and if he persists he is bound to get a wicket. #INDvsPAK
Update on Bhuvneshwar Kumar is that he has tightness in his left hamstring and will NOT be returning to the field today. #INDvPAK
Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar have bowled at least a yard fuller than the Pakistan bowlers did this morning.  Incredible to believe that Amir bowled 7 balls to Rohit in his opening spell and none pitched fuller than 8m. #INDvsPAK
The sun is out at Old Trafford #INDvPAK
Masterful ton by Rohit, his 24th ODI hundred, he is a run machine. On another note could Pakistan have bowled any worse to him? Feeding him short and wide balls along with room outside the off-stump. #INDvsPAK
Why has Rohit Sharma eliminated the flick shot? Here's why ? #INDvPAK https://t.co/01ZiHPSLQW

Full credit to Aaron Finch to bowl Starc. He could have saved him for the latter overs, but went for the attacking option and it has done the trick. #PAKvsAUS
Wahab doing it smartly, it will be the surprise short ball that they need to be aware off #PAKvAUS
Looks like a long tail for Pakistan. Interesting to see if Starc is reintroduced into the attack to run through the lower order #AUSvPAK
This match starting to mirror the Australia v West Indies match. Pakistan should be cruising, but Australia just find a way to pick up wickets. #AUSvPAK
Hard to understand why Pakistan didn't bowl Amir or Wahab when Maxwell came to the crease? #AUSvPAK #CWC19

Regardless of how many Smith scores today, it is fair to say he is very close to his best. It also begs the questions does he continue to bat at 3? #INDvAUS #CWC19
India very particular setting the field for Finch. Short midwicket, no slips, a square leg that is very close. Clear plan to bowl at his stumps. #CWC19 #INDvAUS
Zampa was successful in India because the pitches were holding up slightly and turning a touch. The Oval pitch is on a slower side and flat. No wickets for Zampa and this bowling unit will struggle. #CWC19 #INDvAUS
It was always going to be India's plan to see off Starc and Cummins at the start and then tee off against the rest. Rohit and Dhawan have executed the plan perfectly. Remember India was 0-22 after 7 overs. #CWC19 #INDvAUS
@sellbydave @beastieboy07 @YouTube Thanks Matt. We are back at the Oval a couple of times so we will do a bit of research on that..

Hope gone to possibly the last ball of Cummins spell. In comes Russell, surely Finch turns to Starc sooner than later. #WIvAUS
@jimmaxcricket Could he have played instead of Zampa?
This pitch would have been ideal for Nathan Lyon. Add to that 4 out of the top 5 for WI are left handers. #AUSvWI
@akashfotedar5 It was a huge no-ball.
So the ball before Gayle's dismissal was a massive no-ball by Starc. #WIvsAUS
West Indies have now bowled 20 wides. A lot of them due to the fact they have bowled short on the line of middle and leg. WI will end up bowling four extra overs. #AUSvWI
Brilliant field placement from the WI.  They have had a man behind square for Smith from ball one. It stops him from picking up that easy single of the hip and also acts as a catcher. #AUSvsWI #CWC2019
