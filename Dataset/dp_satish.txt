JDS helped BSP win one seat in the last Assembly elections. Lone MLA N Mahesh is absent. His aides say no instructions from Mayawati to back the coalition. #KarnatakaTrustVote
Congress-JDS trying to delay the #KarnatakaTrustVote as they don't have the numbers. BJP desperate for a quick trust vote. They have the numbers. Only a miracle can save HDK government.
Speaker asks @siddaramaiah what's his point of order. He says anti-defection law has not been struck down by parliament or court of law. When this law exists, some MLAs without the permission of the party in spite of a whip, as a group submitted resignations, not as individuals.

@virsanghvi Agree. Tourism should be a top priority for all governments. Must do a lot and make rules flexible.
Electricity from Sharavathi made #Bengaluru an industrial powerhouse in the last 60 years. Earlier it was 70%. Now gets 25% of its power from Sharavathi. Now the monstrous city wants Sharavathi water. Cauvery takes care of 70% drinking water needs. Ungrateful city remembers none.
