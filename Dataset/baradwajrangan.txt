@aiyyaar Yeah, I guess. But the cinema background segued easily into the high drama of SANJU. This is a much more realistic milieu, and I was really impressed by how smoothly they pulled it off. There are some extraordinary writing choices.
Just saw #Super30. Will put together some thoughts soon, but a few issues apart, this was way beyond what I expected -- the most inventive use of masala tropes in a "regular" setting since GOLI SODA (2014). It's time the biopic was liberated from "realism". This is a great start.
