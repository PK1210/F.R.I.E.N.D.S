Day 16 #MyFavouriteBooks. In all the high art of Premchand and Gone with the Wind and Marquez, one totally unapologetically filmy high pulp worth the film worm! A riveting cover for a delectable book on pioneers of horror in Indian cinema. What a title @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys https://t.co/W8mV6gdWZq
There are some books that adorn my shelves only for the sake of adorning. Gone with the Wind is one such. Never got around to completing it. Though A Suitable Boy, Sacred Games, War and Peace and Anna Karenina have been accomplished. https://t.co/QZmnKgi0J9
Two and a half stars. With Baradwaj Rangan and Mayank Shekhar at #KalingaLiteraryFestival panel on ' How Many Stars: Film Reviews in India' @baradwajrangan @mayankw14 https://t.co/euM77GtpQm
@rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys was I supposed to stop at 7 days or carry on. Am so addicted that it's become the one thing I invariably end up doing every day. https://t.co/B5uO0Si7of
Day 15 #MyFavouriteBooks. A cover that so wonderfully captures the many faces a legend, Apu and Beyond. The only book in English where he talks of his favourite roles. Yet again, cover design #PinakiDe https://t.co/iTD46K519h
Time for DD 2! https://t.co/p2kbTjBHpH
And it is @GulshanGroverGG son who is now actively involved in producing a big Bollywood Hollywood co-venture starring one of the biggest and hottest contemporary stars in Bollywood. Find out about it in #BadMan https://t.co/8fmVfvNyLq
Love this, sir! We all turn a new leaf with the times. :-) The only thing that doesn't change is the joy of seeing you in the 'other role' with Neetu-ji and the magic of #Pancham songs. https://t.co/j3SDGE5uAJ
Day 14 #MyFavouriteBooks. One of my perennial favs. Nothing like curling up on your bed with a good murder! And this is the original first edition reproduction of the book. @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys https://t.co/ig9UHcnKmK
365 would be a good number @rekha_bhardwaj A Book a Day for a year. Now, it's reached a stage where i can't think of the day ending without a book from you! https://t.co/lDEuKqFktX
I have been waiting for a Bond from you for a while @rekha_bhardwaj https://t.co/D9kpTMJSdv
I have placed the book #BadMan on my table and keep looking at it, wondering why @GulshanGroverGG  is frowning at me, what is he up to. Imagine if the cover does that to you, what the book will do! @RoshmilaMIRROR @swatichopra1 @mileeashwarya @PenguinIndia @PreetiMarketINK https://t.co/wPfxuyrr3I
Among the best ever in Indian cinema. @KGunedited @riddhisen896 https://t.co/tEYEmU9CKo https://t.co/Gy4fZ4nWB4
Drivin' in the rain. O happy day! Shashwata misses school and an exam. Life is good. I can't miss office. Life could always be better. https://t.co/9BhoOPtF1V
Day 13 #MyFavouriteBooks. Sometimes books are more than their covers and what lies between them, the way they come about. This one's truly about Two people who were once one and have gone their own way; haath chhute bhi toh rishte... @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys https://t.co/jkwx5YBo5M
Am glad you brought these films up @itsmeabir. Each a unique experience. Now have to find a way to watch #AamiJoyChatterjee @michiganframe https://t.co/6SUXnnGiyo
This calls for one of my own to post... :-) https://t.co/sZ1gAfP7SB
Where's the pot of gold at the end? https://t.co/GtRL1gNdZP
Day 12 #MyFavouriteBooks. The cover says it all. As they say on #GuruPurnima homage to two gurus #SatyajitRay #UttamKumar. Cover, the one and only #PinakiDe https://t.co/ctObfIJQFo

No wonder #RDBurman compositions continue to be red-hot even today, 25 years after he passed away @vittalbalaji @anibhat123 https://t.co/ddYAibntY8
Day 11 #MyFavouriteBooks This one on popular demand of my son - who has made me watch the films and now go through this gorgeous book. For the child and the young in ourselves. @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys can't thank you enough for this wonderful initiative https://t.co/xV0EvHkVGi
Wow! Pahli baar is upanyaas Hindi translation dekha hai. The great Soumitra Chatterjee acted in the novel's film adaptation in 1979 https://t.co/BEXm2VLVML
What a philosophy: bash on regardless. Thank you for bringing such nuggets to us @RakBakX https://t.co/1bnyedmXjQ
Hot off the press. What a pleasure to hold the first copy of #BadMan and to smell the fragrance of the pages. Must be the only #BadMan who smells this good :-) https://t.co/9mjIVjXvqd
That big stars and exotic locations don't make a film. The most charitable takeaway was that this was Dil Chahta Hai lite. Take away @AbhayDeol and you don't even mind not having this Zindagi once, not to mention Dobara. :-) https://t.co/8o50F4h0fI
Dropping Shashwata off at his school. Another variant of Bazeecha-e-atfal jai duniya meray aage... The world here is truly a child's game. Memories of another day.  #MemoriesChildhood https://t.co/CwXvjbzzj7
Academic discussion. Irrespective of genre, geet or ghazal, great song. Here's my favourite though https://t.co/Hfb0kdXkbl https://t.co/ST2tedouAM
Day 10 #MyFavouriteBooks. @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys. I love horror, murder mysteries and detective stories -- great relaxation just before you go to sleep after a tough day. Here's one I love. https://t.co/n7Lp4bjp2l
What a brilliant book this is. I had the privilege of working on its English translation Partitions. One of the great novels of our times. https://t.co/Cn0dzE5cqk
Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold, The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.
Here's to you @ShreyaPunj on your special day. Happy birthday. Have a beautiful day and a blessed life.
Since #KesariyaVilayati is booked, which #BadMan character was named by a real-life gangster turned actor when @GulshanGroverGG emerged from makeup room in trademark grotesque getup? @RoshmilaMIRROR @swatichopra1 @mileeashwarya @PenguinIndia. Days begin &amp; end with #Badman!

:-) love this. I also thought of Ahaa ki anando akashe batashe https://t.co/Gy3FdoRxdU
Yeh toh yaad nahin, par a Jagjit Singh Ghazal goes 'Dhoop mein niklo baarish mein nahakar dekho, zindegi kya hai kitabon ko hatakar dekho'. That's what I tell my son. Is zamane mein Nawab kisko ban-na hai? I would like to rhyme that nawab with aftaab! If that works I am game. https://t.co/sDqZx4KSYJ
@bombaywalee @rekha_bhardwaj Uff! What a cover. What a poet
Day 9 #MyFavouriteBooks. A great author. A cover as 'serpentine' as the novel's brilliant narrative https://t.co/d7kXXPkBFF
Aaj khush toh bahut hogay tum! https://t.co/LVLrVNE1Hj
Nine facts about the man with a 100 faces. I still remember looking for HIS face, more than the hero's or heroine's, on the poster in the films of the 1980-90s. And @GulshanGroverGG never disappointed. @RoshmilaMIRROR @swatichopra1 @mileeashwarya @PenguinIndia @PreetiMarketINK https://t.co/1aAniYy5es

Welcome to the family @chhabs. https://t.co/wzPzSQPfN9
Jalshaghar, Devi, Kanchanjungha (all 3 specifically written by Ray with him in mind), Kabuliwala, Dada Thakur. Ray said of him, 'After his death, I have not written a single middle-aged part that calls for a high degree of professional talent.' https://t.co/cNxI2Gvp5h
When the day begins with Shashwata at his football coaching. https://t.co/KoeC2u0yL3

https://t.co/L5YGOfuFkK https://t.co/hMcM2bNoGP
Day 7 #MyFavouriteBooks. Another Ray classic, everything you ever wanted to know about #PatherPanchali, the film, including lost articles by Subrata Mitra and Bansi Chandragupta. And Ray's storyboard for the film. Another classic #PinakiDe cover. https://t.co/ShbHluz7Ek
Happy birthday @duttaarjun86. May your films after #Abyakto always speak volumes. Much love and wishes. Best.
Am on the way home. But Shaswata mighty kicked his father has celeb friends appearing on prime-time news. One week Amrita aunty @amritabhinder. Then next Gautam uncle @GChintamani https://t.co/yDB5eE7Xem
Following the #BadMan @GulshanGroverGG it's #TheGorgeousLady. Doesn't get any better. In fact, read what #BadMan has to say on #Sridevi. Congratulations @SatyarthNayak. Way to go @mileeashwarya, own writing/publishing on Bollywood. @swatichopra1 @RoshmilaMIRROR @PenguinIndia https://t.co/TYvPZRsI1i
What an evocative cover. And another book I haven't read. https://t.co/gfMdvOiYyz
Incredible. A bestseller even before it is printed! How cool is that. Great going. Love it.  @vikramsampath @premanka @PenguinIndia https://t.co/kBwl3FeKl1
At the end of the day, it is a game. The better team on the day won. All of us have our bad days. You were the best team in the competition. You are the best team in the world. One loss, howsoever disappointing, doesn't change that. Tomorrow is another day @imVkohli https://t.co/lfPKJrFYWe
Read #BadMan to find out how 'Bad Man' and his incredibly talented son #SanjayGrover have built a bridge between the two biggest film industries in the world. @PenguinIndia @mileeashwarya @RoshmilaMIRROR @swatichopra1 https://t.co/X2e7sboDl2
Another one you have to gift me! https://t.co/eqJIzuVDP2
I have read a few others. My high-school &amp; college life was spent between the pages of The Bridge Across Forever, Seagull and in the aisles of dark, dank theatres watching Dharmendra-Mithun-Big B potboilers. No wonder, I turned out the way I have :-) https://t.co/SHVSWE2Rjo
This one's a masterpiece. A biography like few others. I am glad to have had the opportunity of reading. A whole era comes alive in the words of @vikramsampath https://t.co/fng8nbyyI0
You broke the story, Aseem. That's why I tagged you. That story is as incredible as the book and it's cover https://t.co/RKrrV4DK9Q
Day 6 #MyFavouriteBooks. The incredible story of how Ray's screenplay based on his own short story ended up as Spielberg's ET. Cover designed by my fav #PinakiDe, the best designer ever. @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys @chhabs @iDhritiman https://t.co/6jz8W9LXq1
Wednesdays. It's like that all day. You start on that note. You end on that. A one-note day. https://t.co/eCVBiZOpOJ
Haven't read this one. But what a title! https://t.co/3Hzyy5d7Gh
Beginning the day with a note of gratitude to God for everything that I have received. For friends @RakBakX @AkshayManwani and others who have stood firm when all illusions have broken. To @GChintamani for his calls when all seemed lost. There is God all around me.
Day 5 #MyFavouriteBooks. Sankar's cult 1962 Chowringhee. Over 125 reprints. Novel being set in a hotel, cover is a montage of various cities in the shape of stamps. Inspired 2 film adaptations and @srijitspeaketh brilliant poster #ShahjahanRegency. @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys https://t.co/YN4yNqXCcF
This is now going viral @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys. And this viral I don't mind having. https://t.co/07ZPvXdE5M
As the folklore goes about a taxi driver saying, apropos Thande Thande paani se, a potbellied Sanjeev Kumar having a bath in his underpants, 'When it's Haribhai, you don't look at the tonde'. He was fearless. Playing the elderly Thakur or even the Big B's father in his prime. https://t.co/zEtqPhzdxN
Remember the day. What a delight it always is to see @chintskap. Ghar aaja ab pardesi :-). https://t.co/aMCDxmoLcG
What a lovely poem. Before you came this poem was just another poem. https://t.co/Exl8oJVJr1
I have seen home spaces expand to make space for books! https://t.co/YbpagQIwNq
This has the potential to go on and on... Because books are limitless. These days I often find myself thinking of what cover awaits me at the end of the day. And what I can share. https://t.co/YA4NLiGBNv
Read #BadMan to find out how @GulshanGroverGG was tricked into shaving off his moustache. https://t.co/foGabIZ2aj
Yes. Abhogi any day over Twitter! Would have given anything to hear the rendition. #rain #rekha #raga. Doesn't get better. https://t.co/rojuGPPVOU
Day 4 #MyFavouriteCovers. Rarely does a book's title go this well with the look of the image on it. #DarkStar... @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys ... btw, being film worm means a lot of my faves will be film books :-) https://t.co/52KHPyZtVZ
https://t.co/L5YGOfuFkK
Paraphrasing a famous dialogue from another film goes..  moonche ho toh Bad Man jaisi warna na ho. Wonder if anyone else has as many looks as @GulshanGroverGG #TheChameleon @RoshmilaMIRROR @mileeashwarya @PenguinIndia https://t.co/6WL06k5bmV
Ah! This seems to be a day to remember. Wonderful @srijitspeaketh Congratulations @Jisshusengupta u deserve the National Award and more. And @aroyfloyd why is it that anything you win/achieve/compose makes me so happy! https://t.co/lGf2MtVSyO
Many congratulations @sg61us much deserved. Really happy for you. https://t.co/qjTiXmM0Q1
Day 3 #MyFavouriteBooks Here's one of my most cherished. Unlike his other poetry volumes, this does not have his image. Instead his hand, signing, and a watch in the other. Also, the first book that carried his charcoal sketches with his poetry. @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys https://t.co/Hml4Ho2d8i
You have it spot on @rekha_bhardwaj. The first thing I do with a book at a bookstore is smell it. :-) Books, old and new, have their own fragrance. Anyone ever smelt a Kindle edition? :-) and the last word on books, as always, belongs to Gulzar ji https://t.co/Ns87E8MDTV https://t.co/c1AYhYnCXQ
Gurgaon https://t.co/AjCNjkFPSb
Now this is a book you have to give me @rekha_bhardwaj. Haven't seen this one https://t.co/eCIr9Ym7hZ
Day 2 #MyFavouriteBooks. No surprises there... for a film worm, doesn't get better than Ray. @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys https://t.co/aPuHj5ThbO
Nothing like being with the young to feel young. And when they comprise the finest cinema talents in Bengal today, everything seems possible @AnubhavKanjilal @duttaarjun86 (Abyakto) #RanjanGhosh (Hrid Majhare, Ahaa Re) #anuradhamukharjee #shiladityamoulik (Sweater) https://t.co/Pr182kLtgm

Just posted my first cover #MyFavouriteBook https://t.co/e3In5DOqeo
My first post #MyFavouriteBook. Here's to you @rekha_bhardwaj @gulrayys for the initiative. A reader called this rare picture of the Nawab as resembling a Francois Truffaut frame! https://t.co/D9uMDlxKXj
Is it good Twitter etiquette to like your own piece? :-) Thank you @fcompanionsouth for calling this the most definitive profile of a filmmaker I admire but have a lot of issues with too @srijitspeaketh https://t.co/IZn9VVO8Cr
Tagore once said, it's so difficult to be simple. But nothing speaks more eloquently than simplicity. This cover demonstrates that. Thank you @rekha_bhardwaj I am now tempted to start posting my favourites. https://t.co/BzObeFiUA1
All his off-key notes in the commentary box forgiven. #sanjaymanjrekar what a lovely rendition of Tagore and with such wonderful diction too. https://t.co/ERcp1puZJ6

Shashwata tuning in :-) https://t.co/MHeW5HRL9m
You made the next-to-impossible happen in this @kaykaymenon02 stand out in an Amitabh Bachchan film. Still remember every shade of your angst and impatience in #sarkar. https://t.co/QE90OZPcqr
Please let @ZairaWasimmm be. Whatever the reason for her decision - personal, religious it's hers and hers alone. Need to respect that. She has not implied anything and to bring in any intention or Dilip saab, Aamir, Salman, SRK is unfair on her. Ours not to judge her intention https://t.co/F0qwHhLTKL
Another rare and wonderful book https://t.co/jIn59zZPxM
There's something called a Twitter anniversary too! I just had my first! :-)

I too am the correct target audience...:-) yeti, unicorn, dragon, Loch Ness monster, Santa Claus. The innocent beliefs of a lost childhood. https://t.co/WnkViHSovE
Watching @srijitspeaketh Yeti Obhijaan with my son. He is having a blast. Much better to chase the Yeti than following India chase England, says he. Terrific cinematography #soumikhaldar
Can't wait. Did Bad Man have anything to say about Tapasvi Gunjal? Few baddies have such exotic onscreen names @GulshanGroverGG @RoshmilaMIRROR @swatichopra1 @mileeashwarya https://t.co/unukSq8gXL
That makes my Sunday and the next 30 days @rekha_bhardwaj. Your titles you choose are so rare! That too makes it so fascinating https://t.co/2dBn58sgmZ
This is the book that actually made writing on Indian cinema accessible and entertaining in an era when you had books that analysed films by characters on x-axis and narrative on y-axis https://t.co/oTPME1fXdH
What a lovely title too. https://t.co/Q4m16ZGKV3
Maybe we all settle for what is destined. Maybe that's needed to break the ego one might have. When i think my God has failed me, turned out a false, lying God, maybe it was because of my pride in my relationship with God. To bring me to ground and make me realize my frailties https://t.co/RYuLSLniPP
Done, Rekha. I would love to post my favourite covers. Look forward to yours continuing and a hashtag on this. https://t.co/KPCA4MmZl8
From the pictures friends have been sending am reminded of #Gulzar https://t.co/XtpHSkL4EU. And of course the final word on a rain song, the Lata Mangeshkar version of Rimjhim Gire Sawan and Rafi's Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho. https://t.co/sLicvDPldF
Please extend this to 30 days, 30 covers. I am now beginning to look forward to ending my day with this -- spending the whole day wondering what cover it will be today https://t.co/KYQlKc14fL

You are forgiven, my child. The Lord too exited His/Her family group a long time ago. https://t.co/LvZ04DXl9l

We have always been a lawless bloodthirsty inhuman nation. Remember 1947? 1984? 2002? It's just that we didn't have TV and social media screaming it into our faces like now. My GOD died young. https://t.co/mo1svw4drM
What a lovely way to put it. And when you look at it, there are so few that Hemant Kumar sang for Dev Anand. Yet, defined him in so many ways. https://t.co/yq9JsbSTv7
This too, God of Football, from my 12-year-old son, who took your image and inscribed the words on it for your birthday. You have to come to India. My son says you spent a part of your infancy in India Bangladesh @imessi @LionelMessiTeam @TeamMessi https://t.co/wrP8VsT4Ey https://t.co/9gWkH5xXRg
Yes, Akash Kusum, one of his early successes, and that demonstrated his utter childlike. And Kharij, I think that's part of what has come to be called his Absence Trilogy. Thanks @BirsaDasgupta. @fcompanionsouth https://t.co/pSL8HtawgB
@gsmrn @fcompanionsouth And Bhuvan Shome. Heralded the Indian New Wave in 1969

@p1j please start a #nbgmovement. It's shameful how so many such trash is attributed to him https://t.co/Fw0NO8G2GW
@gsmrn @fcompanionsouth Baishey Shravan is a good start. Early Sen. The Calcutta Trilogy (Calcutta 71, Interview, Padatik). Akaler Sandhane. Khandhar.
Amazing how one filmmaker has so many 'cinemas'. The Calcutta Trilogy. The Absence Trilogy. @talkmainak @BirsaDasgupta can suggest with which film to start watching Sen. My favourites #padatik #akalersandhane #khandhar https://t.co/xt5pEznL25

Many congratulations #Ranjanghosh and @RituparnaSpeaks for backing the film https://t.co/qtBwq88EUa
This is an instance where a film is way better than the novel. The novel is a mix of implausible coincidences and serendipities. It's Rituparno Ghosh who elevates it. @raimasen @Jisshusengupta @Ri_flect own the characters. And the way songs are woven into the narrative is wow https://t.co/KoiFUgBUcz
Quoting Bad Man #internationalkhiladi: 'By God, Dil Garden Garden Ho Gaya.' From #sholaaurshabnam:  'Hum jurm ki duniya ka colonel hoon'  to bestselling author of kitabo ki duniya. What a journey! @RoshmilaMIRROR @GulshanGroverGG @mileeashwarya @swatichopra1 @PenguinIndia https://t.co/05twqkNqlK

Really wish this was available to watch on some online forum. https://t.co/dts5qo5h4H
This is so beautiful :-) My son got a translation of Happy Birthday Messi inscribed on an image and asked me to post on every forum possible, just in case Messi saw it by chance! https://t.co/txG5Q1f4gP
One of my favourite songs. And one of my chreished moments of bonding last night with my son as we listened to it for close to an hour. Don't know what a 12 year old made of it, wanting to listen to it again and again; for me an unforgettable experience https://t.co/qwBujU31aH

Happy birthday, Lionel Messi, from my 12-year-old son, Shashwata, your fan from India, who loves and breathes you, watching your goals every day on YouTube. He hopes you will come to India some day, having read you spent a part of your infancy here. @TeamMessi @LionelMessi_Fan https://t.co/GewgSaVkNT
Happy birthday, Lionel Messi, from my 12-year-old son, Shashwata, one of your many BIG fans from India. If you are seeing this, he loves and breathes you. He also tells me that you spent a little time in India during your infancy and hopes you will be back some day https://t.co/KPG48yCyuE
Meryl Streep? Can you tell her how much I love her? https://t.co/Aa7JiLKxyw
So true. Just back performing the final rites of a close relative and the lines in my head are all filmy--yeh zindegi ek rangmanch, zindagi kaisi yeh paheli, thak gaya hoon, zindegi se ladte ladte. So, life and death, joy and pain. All defined in Hindi filmy mode. https://t.co/xqbxqvWaUa

No, no. My awe was you actually got a house in Delhi with birdsong and greenery, rented or owned. I haven't heard a bird in this city in years. https://t.co/GKhQ97MZWr
Satyarth, brother, if the responses are any indication, you have your task cut out - authentic, honest, without pulling any punches, getting her first film right, etc etc. Am I going to love reading this :-) @SatyarthNayak @mileeashwarya https://t.co/RAYBraUxNw
A house surrounded by trees where bird songs wake you up every day, in 7 years -- a 'small' realisable 'dream'? Is dream the operative word here? If not, 'where art thou, brother's :-) https://t.co/yftJ7LMmbO
'What old people say should not be dishonoured. After all they saw the sun first.' Young people can take what they say without calling them 'inappropriate', give them that leeway. They may not be aware of what's 'politically correct'. The young say worse. Look at social media. https://t.co/YvZzljS9zK
All the best, @Fly2Sudipto @swastika24 am sure this will have the full house it so deserves. https://t.co/RlXSeJxnfc
That must have been the sweetest gift of all. Children have such ways to express love that we adults may have forgotten, no? https://t.co/ZNKrb7gx1u
@michiganframe @itsmeabir how does one watch this if one is not in Bangalore? 'Aami Joyful Ray Chaudhuri' hotay chaai, watching Joy Chatterjee. https://t.co/vyxtiFjy5x
Morning What'sApp exchange with my son: Copa America. Argentina-Paraguay 1-1/  Argentina should play Tonga like Matadona said!/Messi scored/Monday is the last match of group stage Argentina-Qatar/Does Argentina have any chance of going to the next stage?
I once read a story / essay by Somerset Maugham where he says something like we are not as wise at 25 as you probably are at 50. But that's the essence of life. We need not undo now what we did at 25 -- because that wasn't stupid. Maybe that was just how wise you were then. https://t.co/AOGtXh8GA7
Thanks a ton. Got a mail. Really appreciate this. https://t.co/QSlAqQUj5M

Ha ha away...I love it. https://t.co/26eSlmq4Ut
Love this. Yes, for those who 'enjoy' films, it's probably the watching that matters most. I came of age in the 1980s, on a diet of Dharmendra Mithun Shatrughan Raaj Kumar potboilers. And yet nothing was more pleasurable than being in those bug-infested halls, cutting college https://t.co/ynikIceJKd
Guys, the only thing I get from the exchange is 'ha ha'. And when you are on your way back home from office at 10 pm, I guess that's good enough. Though I stay as stupid about it as I was on my way to office 12 hours ago! :-) laughing better than learning https://t.co/HtSoqS8tcm
The sanest thing I have read emerging from the state in recent times. There still is hope. And it lies with the common man who shows uncommon wisdom and grace https://t.co/NMCP6fzJX6
Yes. And refrain from making statements like those not speaking Bengali have no place in Bengal. We are one nation with unbelievable diversity. Let's not make it #disunitedstatesofindia by such statements. @MamataOfficial @prosenjitbumba https://t.co/O0yI263YQe

Really not getting this game at all! So, my take: I am Shantanu, from whom the Mahabharata began, and a dud (for not getting this at all). @rukminikumar my editor friend and @VikramParalkar my author friend, tell me please. https://t.co/FnMnqvT0fj

I took my family, 14 of us, grandma, parents, ages 70-7 to Shahenshah. Haven't recovered in 30 yrs. Dad threatened to leave every scene, grandma never watched another AB film. My pocket picked with 8 tickets for friends for another show--The only good thing that came of it. https://t.co/oBOKE2WNjQ

The best end to day... catching up with Shashwata on classic football match goal highlights... today Bayern Munich Vs Man City and Bareclona Vs Man City. Great matches, terrific goals, invigorating end to a tiring day.

Well, he made Soumitra Chatterjee cool as a villain in Jhinder Bandi! In fact cooler than Uttam Kumar, the hero in a double role :-) https://t.co/vs1apnj1zW
It is, and makes a wonderful double bill, about doctors, with the same filmmaker Tapan Sinha's Wheel Chair. A most underrated filmmaker with a glorious body of work https://t.co/eK6bZhx3Pa
Of course we do. How else do we cope with the civic amenities we 'don't' have, the politicians who rule us, the sight of a CM argue with the public like street thugs in a road rage, claims that The Taj was a Shiv temple, that Ganesha was the world's 1st plastic surgery. https://t.co/Ojk9CZmJ0A
Shudder to think that she was a portraying herself as a  potential PM Candidate. Heart in the right place? Anyone who says Bengal for Bengalis cannot have a heart. She climbed down in the doctors crisis only because she was left with no options. No grace here https://t.co/uGM2d78dri
Really? A chief minister who actually says you need to speak Bangla to stay in Bengal? Grace, positivity? A CM who cannot control violence in the first place? We need to get out of this obsequious mentality. I hang my head in shame as a Bengali. @MamataOfficial https://t.co/uGM2d78dri

I have never been a Father's Day kind of father or son. But Shaswata is! Here's his gift of a Parker pen (after that surprise watch) and cake, rounding off a perfect day with the two of us watching Thor Ragnarok, with Panchali not invited :-) https://t.co/1TLweMp4Uu

Is this paternity child care initiative only for those speaking Bengali? The Bengal government should first introspect on providing basic human dignity. Let Didi get her act together, then turn to Fathers https://t.co/ZPQN1nxg0X
Now they attack Shankha Ghosh for his suggestion that doctors get back to their duty. My uncle is in last stage of lung cancer and has been going without treatment because of the doctors' attitude. When did the Hippocratic oath turn hypocritical? https://t.co/5BwHSxfDay
Once was: what Bengal thinks today... Now is: what Bal Thackeray did years ago, Mamata does now. Bengal, hang your head in shame. Everything Bengal stood for, if ever, is gone. This is the end, my 'beautiful' friend https://t.co/Nkz6PUovWP
