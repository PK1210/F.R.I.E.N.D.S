I love that Crosby retweeted the one buttkisser who told him that I’m a jerk and he did nothing wrong. For a songwriter, it’s remarkable how little he is capable of introspection. I feel sorry for him. He should apologize or shut up. https://t.co/4JmorsZoEA

@ZoeyTur @SethAbramovitch We are airing it.
@Matt_Mazur Never.
We'll be airing the episode shortly.
@nickjurich Yes.
Unfortunately, I just had to throw David Crosby out of our podcast studio because he was so incredibly rude. I’m debating whether or not to air the half-hour we recorded before I’d had enough. You should still go see the new doc DAVID CROSBY: REMEMBER MY NAME, which is very good.
