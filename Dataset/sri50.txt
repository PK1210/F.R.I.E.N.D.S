#Aadai is a well made articulate film from @MrRathna without pandering to any sort of titilation. The film revolves around @Amala_ams in a challenging role. She is simply terrific as Kamini. @ramyavj has a meaty role. Post interval it becomes a bit preachy. Still a bold attempt.

#OhBaby 3.25/5. Lovely, heartwarming comedy with an emotional touch from #NandiniReddy, aided by an outstanding performance by fantastic @Samanthaprabhu2 + veteran #Lakshmi , #RajendraPrasad &amp; #RaoRamesh. Only problem is a bit too melodramatic &amp; a run time 161 minutes!

What a start by #NewZealand!

India collapsed and are 5/3 after 3.1 overs, and in trouble! 

#CWC19¬† | #INDvNZ
#India needs 240 runs to win against #NewZealand in 50 overs in first of semi-finals, to enter the finals of #CWC19.
What a sensational piece of fielding by ‚Äòbits and pieces‚Äô player @imjadeja 1. A super throw resulting in a run out 2. What a terrific running catch almost on the boundary line! He is simply terrific!
#INDvsNZ first semifinal of #CWC19¬† resumes at Old Trafford. New Zealand are 217/5 in 46 overs. Looks to be a clear day, and weather forecast is no rains for next few hours.
