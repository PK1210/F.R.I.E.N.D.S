@pettyranch On your run?
@rellanalvarez @lynchsg @soilsdiva Eres my amable. Por lo mismo, vaticino lo mismo acerca de ti y de tu pareja!
Congratulations on your gold medal today, @ModelAyshaMirza ‼️ https://t.co/lHwUN9b5Mx
@Bromka @VoteVarley Oh, and by the way... HAPPY Birthday 🎉🎊🎈🎁🎂‼️
3️⃣GIANTS. Ramsey Lewis, Pat Metheny, Jim Hall. Metheny performs too beautiful “So May It Secretly Begin.” Brought back memories of his ‘As Falls Wichita So Falls Wichita Falls’ fueling all night grad study binges🤓.Featuring Mexican drummer Antonio Sánchez!https://t.co/QC1GgOjhjW
@Bromka @VoteVarley Studies across several marathons point to maximal performance at age 34. This is significantly later than 4 short &amp; middle distances. That’s probably an interaction between learning the marathon and physical potential. U’ve already skewed ur personal curve!https://t.co/EOLVQbIuiX https://t.co/xSJLzyLzJV
Beware: *Actual Musicians At Work.* Santana “Treat.” August 18, 1970 (a year after Woodstock) at Tanglewood. Little known fact: “Treat” originated as the Santana band’s riff on Eddie Harris’ “Listen Here.” Great fun to compare the two! Jazzy sax ➡️ guitar. https://t.co/tsQ8iwiFnk

“I was 11 when my neighborhood gathered to watch Apollo 11. We clustered around a B&amp;W TV when, at dusk in California, Neil Armstrong took his first lunar steps.”

Same. I was 12. Puebla, Mexico. Dad bought our first TV for this. Felt like global community.https://t.co/iaJYXPA8J3
@Bromka @PortlandTrack I believe you! IMHO, you had it with last year’s fitness. Put the “extra time” you gained in the first half into your last half &amp; you’re there (EZ for me to say!) This time around you’ll be fitter as well. Last year’s experience + this year’s work will get you those 41 seconds!👊🏼
@Bromka @PortlandTrack And you didn’t! That is a mind-blowing time. And a mind-blowing effort. Chills!!!
@gibranvita Distinct from form of caloric intake, excess calorie accumulation/storage (overweight) is decisively correlated with many forms of cancer incidence. Of importance because this is largely preventable. Nice state of the art overview from my Instapaper files: https://t.co/bWI8wrToUJ
@gibranvita Latest comprehensive review across genders and multiple cancer types shows (as you’d expect) that the form of caloric intake matters, and that it is a factor, not a dominant driver. Still much to learn about this important factor, however! https://t.co/OgKjAvvAwB
@VoteVarley @Bromka 😉 In the running world, once you hit 30, you’re officially a “Master’s” runner (by koinky dinky, today concludes the 4 days of the North, Central America and Caribbean Region of World Masters Athletics Championships in Toronto!) Based on cumulative data: https://t.co/GljZ2PKd5Z
@rellanalvarez @lynchsg @soilsdiva Lengthy existential conversation with her, ending up with (me): “You could’ve done so much better. I’m so sorry you got stuck with the likes of me.” (Her): “At least you’re not a drunk.”) 😳

Translate both sides into Spanish (once you come in our front door, you’re in Mexico.) https://t.co/3VPbNa3M7m
@_MatthewDillon @Bromka Oh, SO sorry to read that. I don’t have the expertise or context, but can tell you from personal experience that a good sports physio/therapist is worth their weight in gold. That kind of injury really needs personal diagnosis and attention. Don’t waste your time with Dr. Google!

@gibranvita Note that “environment” in the De Gregory et al. research is metabolic, endogenous to organism, not necessarily external insult. Each of the links from: external driver (if any) to internal response, to the set of dysfunctions we call cancer, is its own field of vibrant research.
@gibranvita Sources of error can be intrinsic/extrinsic (e.g., transcription/mutagens.) It is likely that the ratio of these will be contextual (i.e., not static.) &lt;more&gt;
@gibranvita Thanks for this, Gibran. Here’s my model: copy errors are to be expected, and are handled by repair mechanisms. When the effectiveness of repair mechanisms decreases, copy errors accumulate. That is what we call the aging process. &lt;more&gt;
“In some ways, being an old runner is easier.” The ever insightful Peter @bromka drops three important lessons that have seen him improve his performances in his late 30s far above those of his physical peak in his 20s. Don’t pass it up! https://t.co/wUGpt0HGVu

@ModelAyshaMirza Such great news. Keep babying it, and let your youth and biology do their thing. Few things better than a good, restorative meal after a great workout. (Plus, am reading you even have power and everything in Manhattan again today!👍🏽😜)
@ModelAyshaMirza Enjoy the well-earned recovery brunch!
“This is an example of someone who scored well:

@pau_bricio De acuerdo, que buen gusto. Gracias por compartir. Se antoja conocer mas sobre su historia.
@TEVAchrisk @CropProCory See article for details. 19 y of data show inter-annual oscillations. Seeding in W African equatorial belt, nutrient enrichment from Amazon, interacting with surface water temperature, salinity and periodic upwellings. Evidence for nutrient enrichment is P-limited N:P ratios.
@LauraRBelin 🙂 Do what’s right for you!
@LauraRBelin Mostly on roads, sadly. That Rx sells shoes, for sure, though it is loosely based on internal wear that adds up to loss of “springiness.” I’ve always preferred minimalist, responsive, low-rise footwear, so “cush” doesn’t matter as much. As with many things, it’s highly personal!
@Bromka 😬You do same? You can tell my left leg is the strong one and I’m dragging the right. Cipro pulverized my left medial patellar ret. Since it’s not a mechanical insult it’s not responsive to therapy. I’m just patiently letting biology do it’s thing, but old man ligaments are slow!

Coda: I set out to port that CENTLI simulator to OS X, but a change in jobs intervened &amp; that has remained unfinished for 15 years My fantasies involve having the time to do proper modern version with animation &amp; graphical output.🤓😎 A mechanistic maize simulator on iPhone/iPad! https://t.co/9ND1RayzLz
All this might well b tagged #antediluvian. I can only dream of the possibilities had we had Swift/XCode then. But TurboPascal 3.1 was a marvel of efficiency, integrating editor &amp; runtime compiler in 34 Kb RAM! I ran it under CP/M on my Commodore 128 (for its RAM capacity!)😬 https://t.co/57WsHxbYDR
E.g., these are the subroutines called by the main program, each recursively calling various subroutines of their own, with a sample of the core of the simulation, PROCEDURE DevelopEar &amp; output. To read these you only need to know maize biology, not coding. Programming sweetness! https://t.co/1kBj1NGKbV
Love this! Reminded me of main routine of the maize simulation I coded for my PhD, which went thusly:

BEGIN [Main Program CENTLI]

   VegetativeGrowth;
   ReproductiveGrowth;
   Report;

END.

🤓 Pascal’s sweetness! Now, the subroutines called from here, those were serious work! https://t.co/mbZh1mTJPo
