You have to admire New Zealand sport, a small nation that produces such quality players and teams. 

In my experience champion blokes as well.
Amazing day of sport, have to say both teams were a credit to our game! What a final, congrats to #England #englandcricket #CWC19
Just incredible viewing #CWC19Final #CWC19
The best thing for our beautiful game, a 1st time winner! Congrats to the players and fans of England and New Zealand. #CWC19
