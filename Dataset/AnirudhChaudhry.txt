Hey MSK did you see that?
. Anuj Thakral (RAMP) - 7 matches, 11 innings, 37 wickets, best- 6/43 against Maharashtra. 

Nishant Sindhu - 7 matches, 11 innings, 23 wickets, Best- 6/73 against Uttar Pradesh.
. Players stats highlights. 

Yuvraj Singh- 7 matches,  12 innings, 852 runs,  highest score- 218* against J &amp; K. 
                                                               Nishant Sindhu (captain) - 7 matches, 10 innings, 572 runs, highest score - 108* against UP

Piyush Dahiya with a 64 in the second innings https://t.co/Em4XiSzJe2

Sarvesh Rohilla scored 40 in the first innings and 60 in the second. https://t.co/1eYuKUmnJM

Anuj Thakral 5-53. Out of the 66 overs that were bowled, these two bowled about 50 of them!! https://t.co/AwhPLB9LaG
So with about 34 overs to go on the last day and a lead of 558 runs, safe to say that Haryana will be crowned the Vijay Merchant Champions. These u-16 boys have fought hard throughout the season. I will share a few pictures taken by Mr. Kamal Sharma. Vivek Kumar 5-59 https://t.co/fpMaIGHoyc
