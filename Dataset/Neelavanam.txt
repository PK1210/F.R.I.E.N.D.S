Morning was in a domestic goddess mode: Cooked, cleaned the house, watered plants, spent time with my plant folks, made bisibele bath and sambhar powder. Also, some sweets. Well, the right hand is paining and I am low in energy. But my soul is wearing a crown 😃

@ndcnn @GardenLiveNow Wow wow wow. That is a wonderful start for a  Sunday 🌼 Thanks Chitra.
@mdeii :-) You should worry only if it enters the residential drainage channels.  We had that problem. Once, a guest told us that he saw a rat in the commode water. It was embarrassing and scary 😀  Redid the drainage channels after that.
@mdeii The rats will stop coming for a few months at least. When they do, repeat. That is what I do at home. I tried a lot of methods, but don't like the mats or poison. So every time a passing cat poops in the garden, I just drop it in the hole &amp; cover it with soil. Works like charm:-)
@mdeii Ok, What I suggest may sound gross, but it works 'cos I've tested it to drive the coots away from my garden. This is assuming the water that drains is not used for any purpose. Just drop all the dirty sand from your cat's litter box inside the drain entrance. Rat race will stop.
