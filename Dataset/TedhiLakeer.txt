@BhopalHouse Neither am I. When I was transitioning from academics to media, women (who claimed to be friends &amp; held editorial positions) did absolutely NOTHING to support this pretty dire career jump. Fortunately, I didn’t even need their help &amp; soon tables turned.
Indeed. It’s a satisfying verdict. https://t.co/VdEu9u0YAu

Still not okay with New Zealand and Federer losing last night.

Nope!
@mraozing She was incredible when it came to giving love. In her house in Goa, I didn’t feel that we were meeting for the first time. And I could never figure out how her fierce Rottweilers (Ella &amp; Kai) had adopted me instantly as their mausi or Bua. Missing Maggie so much. :(
