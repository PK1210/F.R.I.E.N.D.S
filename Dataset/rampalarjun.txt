Cant wait for Friday. Uffffff what games we will be watching. Brazil vs Belgium France vs Uruguay. #Worldcup2018Russia
Another cliffhanger. EnglandVSColumbia really didn’t know which side I wanted to win. But happy for the winners and sad for the Columbians. Good night all. What a World Cup we are witnessing. #WorldCupRussia2018
What a phenomenal match. Belgium I love this team. How fabulous was Japan. But the counter attack. Genius. Heartaches for Japan. But hats off to Belgium. #BelgiumvsJapan #Worldcup2018Russia
