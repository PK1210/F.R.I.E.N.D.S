RT @DharmaMovies: Did someone ask for the original old age filter app? #KNS @chintskap https://t.co/DwNK0qqPth
I don’t know how long an app takes to age you but this making up took 6 hours daily for 23 days and an hour to remove. But was worth every minute of it. “Kapoor &amp; Sons” https://t.co/5wwrnpiHlf
You are misinformed here. Pran sahab  first worked with RK Films in “Aah” in which he had a positive role of a doctor friend. Raj Kapoor sahab was the main lead with Nargis ji. It was directed by Raja Nawathe released in 1953. Thereon “Jis desh mein Ganga behti hai” and Bobby https://t.co/gwOpkqXzkY

From whatever I have seen on Indian News Channels, the intention of @NiteshNRane was bang on but the way of correcting it was wrong. Find a proper way to punish these corrupt  municipal engineers.The state of our potholed roads and highways are pathetic specially in the monsoons.

You all have a refreshed good five year tenure to go. Please think about this also. We will set examples to Humanity all over @BJP4India @arunjaitley @smritiirani and the PM @narendramodi ji. Please excuse me if I have over stepped but being a citizen I feel my duty to voice it.
After all this is the India we Indians want to see and the whole world envy. Literacy will give the educated youth decent jobs and the sick a full life. A true Democracy-a chance. Demonetisation,cow slaughter ban,anti secular etc...are no answers in my humble opinion! Jai Hind 🇮🇳

Anytime friends. Just reminisced what a film that would be too. Of course we were also worried about an Indian film with Red Indians and Mexican banditos. But Manmohan Desai was totally convinced. Sorry I don’t remember AB’s leading lady
AB here as the “Gringo” in “Khuda Gawah”. Honestly it would have been a sure shot block  buster with what AB,AK and me providing the entertaining portions. Thank you Moses for the rejoinder and the picture. A must for AB fans! https://t.co/QJZXqbxCj3
/3 Film was an action packed comedy with terrific entertainment value. But the film never got made. Alas☹️!imagine if made, Manmohanji would have cracked Sergio Leone too. Lol
/2 It  had a huge star cast of baddies. First schedule without main actors,100 Red indian horses chasing a train was filmed at Karwar, Karnataka was exceptional for those days. They got an archaic steam engine and chopper to film. My first schedule in a bordello saving the girls
Pic from film “Khuda Gawah”produced by Subash Desai( under supervision of Manmohan Desai)directed by Surendra Mohan(79/80)starring AB, myself, Ranjeeta,Kadar Khan,Amjad Khan(both playing Mexican Bandits)was the first time a “Curry Western/Cowboy/Red Indians Mexican bandito”fim https://t.co/u7egydhUJN
