Eddie Newton, who had been assistant manager to Di Matteo and Hiddink in 2012 and 2015-16, respectively, is reportedly will join Lampard’s staff.

Newton’s role as Loan Player Technical Coach is likely to be filled with Claude Makélélé then?

Hopefully for "Chelsea jewel" Jamal Musiala himself this move turns out to be more than just machinations from/by/for his agent, who just happens to be Callum Hudson-Odoi’s brother &amp; agent as well.

'The situation is open, Frank is one of the candidates. the first team will start the preparation, by that time we would like to solve the coach’s question.'

'There were also several other aspects that we talked about after the preparations for the season last year and which were not met. What I have been told has only come true in a few percent. We did not quite get along.'

If Hudson-Odoi’s recovery stays on track, he should be back after the first international break in September, according to the Mail ... which means he would miss just 4 games, plus the Super Cup.

Marca says a fee has been agreed (high end of the €35-50m range) and we have until June 30 (end of loan contract) to get the only sign we can (and should?) make this summer over the line.
