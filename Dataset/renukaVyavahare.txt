@AmritMathur1 Liked the piece as it makes a valid point for players and fans — nothing is bigger than the sport. However, unfair to compare a starry kohli with a modest kane. Cricket is massive in India. Cricketers command a certain attention which explains the behaviour.

With reference to my previous Katrina tweet, it’s funny how people, especially actors who are well behaved don’t get half the publicity as their ill behaved counterparts.

Told a MR the same and his response was hum bhi kabhise rukey hai. I reasoned you are here for business, I am waiting despite high fever and infection, whose wait is more painful? He went in first nonetheless and I had no energy to argue further.
Medical representatives should have the basic common sense of letting the patient meet the doctor first. I totally understand that you meet multiple doctors a day and time is important but you are there for business, others are unwell and you keep them waiting.

I actually liked what #ScarlettJohansson spoke about political correctness in casting. While diversity is most welcome, an actor should be free to play any role he/she pleases to as long as they they do justice to that role.
@ajay36mittal @vickykaushal09 Esp liked him in sonchiriya. Told that to him as well.
@ajay36mittal @vickykaushal09 He is a good actor as well.
Aai loved him in #masaan , baba admired his effortless performance in #raazi , they both liked him in #uri and even the McDowell’s ad. Parents have now officially joined the @vickykaushal09 fan club. “Bollywood has finally found a complete actor” they say and rightly so.
Bored of the #icc jokes. Aagey badho.
@SnehhK @ManasiR To each his own but I have never understood the taboo around using those words as if men have no clue what they are.
@SnehhK @ManasiR My mom’s no different, in fact so many women I know. Saying Undergarments is still fine but many are ashamed to say bra and panty openly. My mom insists i use a shopping bag in a mall while shortlisting these things as why should people see what bra and chaddi you are buying 😁
