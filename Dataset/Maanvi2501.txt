A tweet on Partition literature reminded me of a book I'd studied in my undergrad and I say this quite a lot, but: I miss being a literature student. The sense of discovery when you're lost in a text or the satisfaction of writing a well-argued paper is just something else.
@nsaikia @RohanV Also, the films &amp; background readings are a great companion to the fiction. Especially Urvashi Butalia's Other Side of Silence which, in my opinion, is a book everyone should read.

What's slowly happening to #SareeTwitter is a good reminder of why I DON'T want to be online on most days. 

To be silent will be to cede space &amp; to disappear. 

But at what cost -- mental, physical, professional -- do we dig in? (4/4)
Worrying about women's safety online means not taking the occasional risk to *live* online as we want. To post a joke. Or a life experience rant. Or a pretty photo in a sari. Just because we want to. #SareeTwitter should be fun and harmless and lovely. But, nope. (3/n)
Women are facing disgusting comments for the blouse they are wearing, others are told filthy things in replies just because they're public figures &amp; even more dangerously, others are hearing of their photos being misused on WA groups! (2/n)
Every time I've seen a #SareeTwitter photo, I've marveled at gorgeous women living their best life. But I've been wary. Because this is Twitter, where visibly public &amp; opinionated women are inundated with vicious trolling; until they quit.

Sadly, that's what's happened. (1/n)

Where does our limited knowledge on instances of male rape survivors or male victims of physical abuse in India come from? Feminist orgs and activists. Where does "mard ko dard nahin hota" come from? Men holding onto their ideas of toxic masculinity. Read a damn book.
If you're talking about men's rights ONLY to undermine women's issues, you're masking your misogyny with concern about 'equality' You know why women are angry about Kabir Singh? Because it promotes toxic masculinity which prevents men from speaking up on rape/physical abuse (2/n)
*deep breath* Physical abuse by man OR woman is reprehensible BUT since every 3rd woman in India, since the age of 15, has faced domestic violence in some form, acc. to NHFS-4 (2018), it makes sense to call out a film glorifying that violence (1/n)
