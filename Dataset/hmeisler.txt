@KevinVandermee1 looks like (and this from raw data so i'm eyeballing it) June was heavier than July but that rally in August was pathetic volume.
@KevinVandermee1 Sorry, don't have it. Oh wait, maybe I can look it up. hang on
And 50 trading days ago was May 9th. That means the 50 dma's are about to drop the May decline.
Fun Fact: 200 trading days ago was October 2nd. That means the 200 dma is about to drop the 4th quarter decline numbers.
@futuresbestia what do you mean time frame? that circle is July 20th. This is a daily chart.

@Star_Investor See my pinned tweet. And if you still don't understand it you will probably find my twitter feed useless.
@ripsterlicious will it be a top or a low?
@nate04448044 lol
@topelourenco I can't. It is a subscription based survey. I wrote about it here with a chart.
https://t.co/6wv1mfNfDA
I want to make a point about sentiment. Everyone citing AAII because bulls are 'only' 36%. No one citing II (more reliable, more scientific) where bulls are 58%, highest since October high when they were 61%
Has Minerd changed his view yet? Is he back to looking for 2400?

@JoelHeyman Sadly I'd bet not many do.

@JamieSaettele you think it takes two weeks?!
I have been off the desk most of the day. Is it 25 or 50 bps today?
@onebeastwon thank you.
@jbarro So they will take away his phone a month before the election so he can't 'mess it up'.
@iuubob ew.
@IdeasNon been bullish them for a while. They have not been kind to me. Can write up the chart next week.

@francois101com @BullandBaird I've never been terribly good at the HO stuff. So many moving parts.
@BullandBaird It is the most un-scientific survey out there. This week might be 100 respondents, next week 1000. And they might be all different each time.

@tunstall_john yep
Great story of the picture we all know from the Moon landing.

Nice write up this morning @LJKawa with the Godfather reference.
@jennablan He also called for a market melt up just before we tanked 7% in May so let's just say his market calls are somewhat suspect.

@bradkern Really? You just took one when you said you called the December low :)
@bradkern I won't save it. You know why? I have a very strong feeling that you will be all too happy to take a victory lap in my timeline if you get it right. So let me save you the time: don't do it.

@frankiryami I don't. This is just fun now.
I don't understand why the Fed doesn't just go a full point on the first cut. Get on with it instead of doling it out.

@MylesUdland there ya go. you're picking winners now :)
@BullandBaird @MylesUdland @selling_theta I didn't say that. I just said that NFLX hasn't been a participant so I don't know how you can think it's important. i.e. probably not overowned and overloved.
@MylesUdland @selling_theta If you take out the rally to mid Jan my guess is the rally was not so hot. that's my point. if you DIDN"T rally off the December low you're really awful but if you are a growth stock &amp; haven't rallied all year, do you really matter?
@CAVandy oh hah!
@wboscoho @MylesUdland @selling_theta nothing magical. it's the way they work, the way they have worked forever.
@CAVandy weren't you tweeting Paris pics the other day? Maybe I was dreaming!
@MylesUdland @selling_theta NFLX has gone nowhere this year and the major indexes are up. It is a gnat that flies around, not a market mover.
@CAVandy Thought you were in Paris.
@MylesUdland @selling_theta That's the beauty of markets. If you knew what might take us down then it would be priced in already, wouldn't it?
@SidewaysEnglish If you say so. I disagree but that's what makes markets.
As the SPX gets better the RUT goes down.

@Fullcarry is it over that 2000 high yet? Still shy of 1999 but I can't tell 2000. ty

NVDA over its 200 dma for the first time since October.

@selling_theta non-ice cream products. like low fat. low sugar, etc.
@sunny051488 EPS always been about lowering the bar and beating. And I've been at this almost 4 decades. Nothing new.
@DavidSchawel Have they? Never noticed.
@danieldurandp it might. might go on to make new highs. but the last 6+ months have been nothing.
