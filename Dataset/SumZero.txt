@NegDiscountRt Nothing since Jan '18, but a sample of the update from then: "$FCAU remains a SOTP story. Looking at only the auto brands, the combined value of the Co could exceed $32. Jeep and Maserati together could be worth the current share price." https://t.co/nlUM87d70Q

@traderunnerFX That "sounds" right. Curious what the data may reveal about any social bias, as well as anything in terms of underlying performance. Strong likelihood there is nothing to see in the data, but still an interesting concept. Worth a look.
@BarbarianCap Looks like these TWTR poll responses are going to be less than conclusive and actionable. At some point, we will take a more serious look at it. May be something there.
With a recovery (sort of) underfoot, another $CMG short hits the SumZero tape: https://t.co/jkGdQHDtqh https://t.co/HMyuw3DXYo
@jposhaughnessy Good point. We see it as a frequent practice even at one-man shops. At some point, would like to run a more serious analysis on it. Could be interesting.
"The comp between our tech monopolists today and robber barons of the Gilded Age seems unfair. 9% of Carnegie's workforce died annually working in his steel mills. Monopolies created terrible working conditions, underpaid individuals..." @selectivewm $FB https://t.co/LDa2SfNmeI

(3) "A company‚Äôs penchant for share-based compensation often goes hand-in-hand with extreme levels of remuneration. We would also argue that stock awards undermine employee morale."
(2) "If stock awards are a prerequisite to align employee interests with those of shareholders, the largest shareholder at Berkshire Hathaway, @WarrenBuffett, has a
massive problem with 377,000 employees who are only paid in cash."

[On launching a new fund] The price of entry for institutional capital has gone up dramatically thanks to Madoff. Institutions now require an admin, often a CFO, and possibly analyst(s). The burn rate for new funds out of the gate is much higher now. https://t.co/O3DBFbuftQ
