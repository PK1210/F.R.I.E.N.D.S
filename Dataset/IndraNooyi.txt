Growing up, I saw how a sport like cricket can transform a person and a country. It was an honor to be featured in @AbhinayDeo’s movie Doosra, which shows how cricket changed India through the eyes of a young girl. I encourage you to watch the trailer: https://t.co/nwr9qK1CbL
For 15 years, @MLTOrg has been dedicated to developing high-impact diverse leaders. Congratulations to my friend, @MLTJohnRice on this milestone. You are building a better future by empowering our youth and bringing more voices into the workplace.
With so much information at our disposal today, it often seems that there is no single version of the truth. “Factfulness" by Hans Rosling sheds light on this and teaches us how to interpret facts. A fascinating read that's helped me view the world through a more discerning lens. https://t.co/IA3ZMBycjS
Cricket has always been part of my life, and coming from a town where there was no women’s team before we created one, it was an emotional experience visiting @MCG, host of the @ICC Women’s #T20WorldCup in 2020. What a powerful celebration of women and the game of cricket! https://t.co/GOF6DV9Vkx
So much of who I am today stems from the fact that my father and grandfather told me that I could do anything a boy could do. To all of the fathers and father figures out there who are instilling this same level of confidence in their children, thank you and happy #FathersDay!

My heart breaks for the loss of life and all those injured at the Tree of Life congregation in Pittsburgh. May we all learn to respect and love one another for our differences.
This month, @Marriott’s Arne Sorenson asked @Pepsico to join @BizRoundtable's #EmbracingSustainability Challenge by demonstrating how we are reducing our environmental impact.

Today on #WomensEqualityDay, let's honor the women who push for a more equal world. Rosa Rivera served as the first female sales rep &amp; supervisor in her @PepsiCo distribution center, and recently won a Ring of Honor award — her story is such an inspiration. Who inspires you? https://t.co/I2kDhsT4yo
John McCain was a hero and a patriot who embodied the best of this country. He inspired us to strive for that more perfect union and we will miss him dearly. My thoughts are with Cindy McCain and the entire McCain family.
@vsikka Thank you for your note and support — it means so much coming from someone whose tireless entrepreneurial spirit I admire greatly.

@melindagates @PepsiCo Thank you for your kind words — hearing this from a woman who's done so much for so many women around the world means a lot.
@kiranshaw @kiranshaw Thank you – I couldn't have gotten to this point without the support of other women in business. We must continue to look for opportunities to uplift and celebrate each other.
@NandanNilekani @EconomicTimes @NandanNilekani I'll never forget our conversation — it was just one year after I stepped into the CEO shoes and it was so helpful to sit down and discuss our business model with you. I'm humbled by how much we've both grown since!
@sachin_rt @sachin_rt Although in my playing days I never scored quite as many runs as you, Sachin, I couldn’t have reached this point without the lessons the game of cricket taught me. It means so much to hear this from someone who’s done so much for the game and the world — thank you.
@ariannahuff @ariannahuff I can't tell you how much this means coming not only from one of the world's leading voices on media, health, and wellness — but also a dear friend and remarkable mentor. Here's hoping the days ahead bring more hours of sleep.
RT @MadMoneyOnCNBC: .@JimCramer's personal experience with $PEP's @IndraNooyi helped him believe in the company's long-term vision https://…

With technology so present in our lives, I often wonder: have we gone too far? I recently read “Your Happiness Was Hacked” by @AlexSalkever &amp; @wadhwa, and was captivated by their take on this question — add it to your list! https://t.co/2g4gOVPypz
We’re thrilled that @PepsiCo &amp; @TheGarden, two legendary New York companies, will be on the same team starting Sept 1. It’s an honor to now be part of their iconic family, and I can’t wait to see what we achieve together. https://t.co/p1B2YtPoT5

The loss of life &amp; destruction caused by the aftermath of the #earthquake in Mexico is shattering. You are in my thoughts. #FuerzaMexico
When disaster strikes it's up to all of us to band together &amp; support those who need help. To push to solve for what might seem unsolvable.
In the words of JFK, “Man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable."
