@philhadley Hey!!!
@philhadley I wasn’t working tonight so you would have watched me absolutely demolish a packet of chocolate raisins.
@RED_OKTOBER1917 Nah you’re allowed to tweet for sure. Just not something that is unnecessary aggressive pre show. 
And thanks, Josh and I always have a great time on the road. Xx
@LexyRMiller No it would be better to say ‘hey looking forward to seeing you tonight, have a great show!’
@hollieketticus Look, I’ll pop on a nice shirt and do my best!
@larbertred I’m not working tonight but I appreciate your tweet.
@LukeKempner @sarabarron @MrRyanJDalton @jesterjacobs 😘😘😍😍😍🤓🤓
Anyone that’s ever tweeted a comedian to say ‘I’m coming to see you tonight, you better be funny’ is almost always a full time wanker.
