@VAVetBenefits @DoDFINRED Thanks for chatting with us today, and special thanks to the VA beneficiaries who have served our country and deserve our help to become financially capable. Remember, before you invest, https://t.co/zPX8GFOSYv. #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A9: The SEC does not endorse or promote any ICO or other investment product. Watch out if anyone tries to make that claim that the SEC or any federal government agency endorses an investment. #askVBA https://t.co/nZaPgL15EJ
@VAVetBenefits A9: SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has issued a statement on cryptocurrencies and ICOs and has a list of questions you should consider before investing in them: https://t.co/aRmh6tOK7X #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A9: Thinking of investing in ICOs or digital assets? There are risks, including the fact that you could be dealing with an unregistered security, an offshore or non-existent exchange, or a complete scam. Check out our Spotlight page on ICOs: https://t.co/Sczs4Ko46z #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A8: Be suspicious of any investment that sounds too good to be true. Claims that an investment is a “can’t miss” opportunity or promises “guaranteed” returns are classic warning signs of fraud! #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A8: A lot of investment scams are committed by people who aren’t licensed or registered to sell investments or give investment advice. Make sure you’re dealing with a registered investment professional with a free, simple search at https://t.co/zPX8GFOSYv.  #askVBA https://t.co/eTlO2aFAdQ
@VAVetBenefits A8: There are more than 21 million veterans in the U.S. – that’s more than 21 million potential targets for fraud. A scammer may even be a veteran or at least pretend to be. Learn how you can protect yourself: https://t.co/Txn5LS5s2l #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A7: And remember: You can keep your TSP from your time in the military, and continue to take advantage of the low fees and diversified investment options. Once you leave your civilian job, you can roll your civilian 401(k) into your TSP if it makes sense for you. #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A7: If multiple funds are offered in the workplace plan, pay attention to fees, and run all the options through FINRA’s Fund Analyzer to get an apples-to-apples comparison of the fees you’ll be charged: https://t.co/GwNuk9Wfn5 #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A7: If your employer offers a 401(k), take advantage of it, especially if there is a “match” for contributions. You get a tax break when you contribute to a 401(k). #askVBA #FinancialCapability
@DoDFINRED @VAVetBenefits A6: Agreed @DoDFINRED! If your employer offers to match your retirement plan contributions up to a certain level, you may want to contribute at least enough to meet the match. That’s free money, and you get a tax break. #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A6: High interest debt, like credit cards or retailer cards, can charge 13, 17, even more than 24 percent interest! Few legitimate investments will pay that sort of return, so it probably makes sense to tackle high interest debt first. #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A5: Consider target-date funds (like the Lifecycle Funds in TSP) that adjust your mix of investments from a more aggressive, return-seeking mix early in your career to a more conservative mix as you approach retirement.  #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits Whoa indeed! That's the power of investing consistently over time and compound interest. 👍
@VAVetBenefits A5: One way to diversify is with products like mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) that combine diversified portfolios (many different stocks or other investments) with professional management.  #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A5: One of the most important ways mitigate risk is to diversify your investments--don't put all your eggs in one basket! If you buy a mix of different types of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, your overall holdings will not be wiped out if one investment fails. #askVBA
@VAVetBenefits A5: Money invested can grow over time through the power of compounding. A single investment of $1000 today can grow to nearly $15,000 after 40 years at 7% interest. #askVBA #FinancialCapability
@VAVetBenefits A4: It pays to start early! Use our Compound Interest Calculator to see how the money you invest may grow over time: https://t.co/yaPp3rCgrh #askVBA https://t.co/RlePjCX5yG
