Nine years ago, I had an idea for a film collective dedicated to images by underrepresented filmmakers. Each day, we worked on the idea with a full time staff of 2. Yesterday, we had our first off-site retreat with our team of 17. Proud. Grateful. Much love respect to @ArrayNow! https://t.co/GtyuQKWiHz
Until you address the lack of human dignity and health at the border, see to Puerto Rico properly, call off your zombies chanting white supremacist slogans, apologize for “both sides,” diversify your cabinet and fire your daughter, nobody cares about your token concern. https://t.co/eoXh25Alt5

@willsssmith Shame on you.
Always start with the actor. Mistake made by directors starting out is to skip this. Whenever possible - and sometimes it isn’t - get on the same page with the actor about movement, THEN set camera. Watching this is hilarious to me, but maybe it’ll help someone out there. 🤷🏽‍♀️ https://t.co/tcmEJLs0Qu

I remember when the LBJ fanatics waged a campaign against SELMA to try and re-write history. It’s a tired play from an old boy’s handbook. Everything they are doing now with the women in Congress is the same game. They’re all afraid of new rules and new players. And new winners. https://t.co/OBTw6PlUGs
Congrats to the great Aisha Coley. A silent hero of many films by black directors. From LOVE + BASKETBALL to 25TH HOUR to every film, TV project, commercial + installation I’ve done, she’s discovered many of your favorite stars. This week, she was nominated for her first Emmy. https://t.co/7ms8SfRROw

@nilofer Wow.  🙏🏾
Then you’re outside and it hits you. You can’t believe it. You are not cool. You are a big nerd. And you love telling stories. And you can’t believe how many people watched! And when and where and how they watched! And there are tears. And there is dancing. And you are happy! https://t.co/aJsMOZsCwz
It’s like having the best secret but you can’t tell people because your friend told you not to and that friend is really serious and has a lot of muscles and will literally beat your ass if you tell. So you don’t tell. You just try to play it cool while you’re in the building. https://t.co/78wg3imDW8

This scene always hurts my feelings. It is cut so beautifully by the maestro, @SpencerAverick. Jharrel Jerome + Vera Farmiga give a masterclass in torment and trauma. Embodying Korey and Lederer.
